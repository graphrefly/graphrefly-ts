# SESSION: Extras Wave 1 Audit — Higher-Order Operators

**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Status:** Wave 1 COMPLETE — all *Map upgraded to B (fn+closure); forwardInner OPEN-1 resolved; mergeMap BUG-1+3 fixed; equals multi-DATA skip added; BUG-2 fixed (firstValueFrom/firstWhere shouldUnsub); withLatestFrom secondary-without-data guard added; sentinel gate swallowing secondary ERROR fixed (pre-dirty removed from `_activate`, terminal bypass added in `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement`, `onFailure` given `errorWhenDepsError: false`)  
**Scope:** `src/extra/operators.ts`, `src/extra/sources.ts`, `src/extra/composite.ts`

---

## Context

Following completion of the foundation redesign (SESSION-foundation-redesign.md), this session
audits the `src/extra/` operators for semantic correctness, design invariant compliance, test
coverage, and composability. The session uses a phased wave structure; see **Strategic Plan:
Extras Review & Hardening** below for waves 1–5 and the per-file review protocol. This document
covers **Wave 1: higher-order operators**.

Foundation redesign invariants in scope:
- **P2:** `onMessage` handles protocol, `fn` handles data only
- **P3:** No cross-node inspection — `.cache` / `.status` are external APIs; use protocol
- **P4:** START handshake disambiguates "no value yet"
- **P6:** Tier-based unification — reduce special cases

---

## Strategic Plan: Extras Review & Hardening

This session log focuses on **Wave 1** only; the full extras review is organized as waves 1–5
below.

### Ordering rationale

The foundation redesign established new invariants (P2 signal/data split, P3 no cross-node
inspection, P4 START handshake, P6 tier-based unification). Extras are validated **bottom-up**:
simpler operators first, then higher-order operators that compose them, then data structures,
resilience, and finally adapters.

### Wave 1 — Higher-order operators (pain points first)

**Files:** `operators.ts` (switchMap, withLatestFrom sections) + `composite.ts`

These are the most semantically subtle; foundation redesign is most likely to have invalidated
assumptions here. Tackle them first while context is fresh.

For each operator:

1. **Semantic audit** — Does it correctly handle: START before first DATA? Terminal propagation
   (one upstream vs all upstreams)? Inner subscription lifecycle on cancel/switch? Backpressure
   interactions?
2. **Invariant check** — P2: `fn` only touches data, `onMessage` only touches protocol. P3: No
   `.get()` / `.status` calls across nodes inside operator impl.
3. **Simplify** — Higher-order operators tend to accumulate special cases. After understanding
   current behavior, ask: can we reduce to fewer state variables?
4. **Stress scenarios** — For each: rapid upstream switching, terminal from inner, terminal from
   outer, zero-emission inner, cold vs hot source, diamond topology feeding the operator.
5. **Test audit** — Verify tests actually exercise the scenarios above, not just happy-path.

**Order within Wave 1:**

| Operator | Why first? |
|----------|------------|
| `switchMap` | Most stateful — inner subscription management is where bugs hide |
| `withLatestFrom` | START-before-DATA ordering bug is classic here |
| `firstValueFrom` / `firstWhere` | Simpler but terminal-on-first-value needs to be airtight |

### Wave 2 — Core Tier 1 operators and sources

**Files:** `operators.ts` (remaining Tier 1: map, filter, merge, combine, scan, etc.) +
`sources.ts`

Lower semantic risk but high surface area. Focus:

- Uniform terminal propagation pattern
- START handshake correctness (P4)
- `fromPromise` / `fromAsyncIter` async boundary compliance (no raw `Promise` in node fn)

### Wave 3 — Resilience + backpressure

**Files:** `resilience.ts`, `backpressure.ts`, `backoff.ts`, `timer.ts`

These use the `ResettableTimer` escape hatch (Spec §5.10). Verify:

- Every raw timer use is justified and documented
- State machines (circuit breaker, retry) handle terminal correctly — don't retry after terminal
- Rate limiter doesn't buffer indefinitely under backpressure

### Wave 4 — Reactive data structures

**Files:** `reactive-map.ts`, `reactive-list.ts`, `reactive-index.ts`, `reactive-log.ts`,
`pubsub.ts`

Focus on the two-phase DIRTY→DATA emission contract and version counter semantics.

### Wave 5 — Adapters + worker bridge

**Files:** `adapters.ts`, `worker/`

Last because they depend on everything above being correct. Slice `adapters.ts` by protocol
family (HTTP, WebSocket, streaming, message queues) rather than one monolithic pass.

### Per-file review protocol

For each file, in order:

1. Read implementation cold
2. List: what invariants could this violate?
3. Run existing tests — do they pass? Are the assertions semantically meaningful?
4. Write stress scenarios (as test cases or mental models)
5. Simplify: remove dead branches, collapse special cases, unify patterns
6. Fix any violations found
7. Verify tests cover all scenarios from step 4

### Starting point for Wave 1

Begin with **`switchMap`**: read the relevant section of `operators.ts`, map the current state
machine, then stress-test semantics before changing code. That yields a template for the rest.

---

## Wave 1 Operator Set

| Operator | File | Current pattern |
|----------|------|----------------|
| `withLatestFrom` | operators.ts:703 | `node([primary, secondary])` + `ctx.dataFrom` |
| `switchMap` | operators.ts:1021 | `producer` + `forwardInner` |
| `exhaustMap` | operators.ts:1080 | `producer` + `forwardInner` |
| `concatMap` | operators.ts:1141 | `producer` + `forwardInner` + queue |
| `mergeMap` / `flatMap` | operators.ts:1234 | `producer` + raw inner subscribe |
| `firstValueFrom` | sources.ts:818 | Promise bridge + `queueMicrotask` |
| `firstWhere` | sources.ts:865 | Promise bridge + `queueMicrotask` |
| `forwardInner` | operators.ts:957 | shared inner-subscription helper |

---

## Bugs Found

### BUG-1: `mergeMap` — inner ERROR leaks subscription and inflates `active` count

**Location:** `operators.ts` `spawn()` function (~line 1262)

`spawn()` collects non-COMPLETE messages into `out` and forwards them, then only calls
`runStop()` / `active--` / `drainBuffer()` / `tryComplete()` on `sawComplete`. An inner ERROR
goes into `out` (forwarded correctly), but `sawComplete` stays false — so cleanup never runs.

**Consequences:**
1. Errored inner's `stop` fn stays in `innerStops` forever — memory leak
2. `active` inflated → concurrent limit wrong → buffered items behind the limit never drain
3. If all inners error, `tryComplete()` never satisfies `active === 0` → mergeMap never completes
   even after source completes

Contrast: `switchMap` / `exhaustMap` / `concatMap` all use `forwardInner` which correctly
calls `finish()` on ERROR (treating it as terminal).

**Fix (minimal):** track `sawError` in `spawn`, call `runStop(); active--; drainBuffer(); tryComplete()`
after forwarding the error — mirroring the `sawComplete` branch. Inner ERROR does NOT cancel
siblings (intentional isolation), just cleans up its own slot.

```typescript
// In spawn():
let sawComplete = false;
let sawError = false;
const out: Message[] = [];
for (const m of msgs) {
    if (m[0] === COMPLETE) sawComplete = true;
    else if (m[0] === ERROR) { sawError = true; out.push(m); }
    else out.push(m);
}
if (out.length > 0) a.down(out as unknown as Messages);
if (sawComplete || sawError) {
    runStop();
    active--;
    drainBuffer();
    tryComplete();
}
```

---

### BUG-2: `firstValueFrom` / `firstWhere` — `queueMicrotask` violates design invariant

**Location:** `sources.ts:827`, `sources.ts:876`

Both use `queueMicrotask(() => unsub())` to defer unsubscription. This is a "chicken-and-egg"
workaround: if the source pushes synchronously (e.g., `state(42)`), `unsub` isn't assigned
yet when the callback fires.

**Invariant violated:** §5.10 "No bare `queueMicrotask`, `setTimeout`, or `process.nextTick`
in the reactive layer."

**Fix — synchronous `shouldUnsub` pattern:**

```typescript
export function firstValueFrom<T>(source: Node<T>): Promise<T> {
    return new Promise<T>((resolve, reject) => {
        let settled = false;
        let shouldUnsub = false;
        let unsub: (() => void) | undefined;

        unsub = source.subscribe((msgs) => {
            for (const m of msgs) {
                if (settled) return;
                if (m[0] === DATA) {
                    settled = true;
                    resolve(m[1] as T);
                    if (unsub) { unsub(); unsub = undefined; }
                    else shouldUnsub = true;
                    return;
                }
                if (m[0] === ERROR) {
                    settled = true;
                    reject(m[1]);
                    if (unsub) { unsub(); unsub = undefined; }
                    else shouldUnsub = true;
                    return;
                }
                if (m[0] === COMPLETE) {
                    settled = true;
                    reject(new Error("completed without DATA"));
                    if (unsub) { unsub(); unsub = undefined; }
                    else shouldUnsub = true;
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
        if (shouldUnsub) { unsub?.(); unsub = undefined; }
    });
}
```

Same pattern for `firstWhere`.

---

### OPEN-1: `forwardInner` — P3 violation: `.status` and `.cache` post-subscribe reads

**Location:** `operators.ts:992–996` (tracked in `docs/optimizations.md` as P3 audit #1)

```typescript
if (!emitted && (inner.status === "settled" || inner.status === "resolved")) {
    a.emit(inner.cache as R);
}
if (inner.status === "completed" || inner.status === "errored") {
    finish();
}
```

These post-subscribe reads are a guard for "inner was already settled/terminal before
subscribe". But per the P4 START handshake, subscribe delivers `[[START]]` (no cache)
or `[[START], [DATA, cache]]` synchronously. If the first callback batch already
delivers DATA, `emitted = true` is set inside the callback, and the `.status`/`.cache`
checks at lines 992–996 see `!emitted = false` and short-circuit.

**Assessment:** The post-subscribe reads are likely **unreachable dead code** for any
node that delivers START+DATA synchronously in the first callback invocation (all current
nodes). The `.status === "completed"` guard handles already-terminal inners — but a
terminal node's subscribe delivers `[[START], [DATA, last], [COMPLETE]]` in one batch,
which sets `emitted = true` and calls `finish()` before the post-subscribe check runs.

**Decision pending:** Remove the post-subscribe reads and rely entirely on the START
handshake in-band delivery. Needs explicit verification that every node type delivers
all relevant state in the first subscribe batch.

## Test Gaps

| Missing scenario | Operators |
|-----------------|-----------|
| `firstWhere` — zero tests | `firstWhere` |
| Primary fires before secondary has any value | `withLatestFrom` |
| Outer COMPLETE while inner still active | `switchMap`, `exhaustMap`, `concatMap` |
| Source COMPLETE while inner still active, then inner completes | `switchMap` |
| Inner ERROR → fresh outer DATA creates new inner | `switchMap` |
| DIRTY propagated then inner switches mid-wave | `switchMap` |
| Source COMPLETE while inner still active | `exhaustMap` |
| Inner ERROR propagation | `exhaustMap`, `concatMap` |
| `maxBuffer` overflow drops oldest (not newest) | `concatMap` |
| Inner ERROR: slot cleaned up, active decremented, next completes correctly | `mergeMap` |
| Concurrent limit: drain after inner completes | `mergeMap` |
| Inner ERROR does not cancel siblings | `mergeMap` |
| mergeMap completes after all inners error + source complete | `mergeMap` |
| PAUSE/RESUME from downstream while inner is active | all `*Map` |

---

## switchMap Deep Dive

### Current implementation (A — producer pattern)

```
producer<R>((a) => {
    let innerUnsub     // handle to current inner; undefined when no active inner
    let sourceDone     // latched true on source COMPLETE

    attach(v):
        clearInner()   // synchronously tears down previous inner
        innerUnsub = forwardInner(fromAny(project(v)), a, () => {
            clearInner()
            if sourceDone → a.down([[COMPLETE]])
        })

    source.subscribe(msgs →
        DATA      → attach(v)
        ERROR     → clearInner() + forward error downstream
        COMPLETE  → sourceDone = true
                    if !innerUnsub → a.down([[COMPLETE]])
    )
    return teardown: srcUnsub() + clearInner()
})
```

`forwardInner` manages the inner subscription:
- Skips START
- DATA → `emitted = true; a.emit(v)`
- COMPLETE → `finish()` (calls `onInnerComplete`)
- ERROR → forward + `unsub()` + `finish()`
- else (DIRTY, RESOLVED) → `a.down([m])` — forwards wave signals to outer's downstream

The `else` branch forwards DIRTY and RESOLVED from inner through the outer producer node's
`a.down()` directly to its subscribers. This means the outer node participates in the inner's
wave without declaring the inner as a framework dep.

### RxJS / callbag differences

| Dimension | RxJS `switchMap` | GraphReFly `switchMap` |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Settled inner replay | No concept | Yes — `forwardInner` replays `inner.cache` if already settled |
| Batch of outer values | Each item creates/destroys inner | Same — N outer DATAs in one batch → N attach() calls |
| RESOLVED forwarding | No concept | Yes — DIRTY/RESOLVED from inner forwarded for wave coherence |
| Source COMPLETE + active inner | Waits for inner | Same — `sourceDone` latch |
| Diamond coordination | N/A | Not provided by A (producer not a declared dep) |

### Alternative B — fn+closure: declare source as dep, use `node()`

From `docs/optimizations.md` (open item, proposed 2026-04-11).

```typescript
export function switchMap<T, R>(source, project, opts): Node<R> {
    let innerUnsub: (() => void) | undefined;
    let sourceDone = false;

    return node<R>(
        [source as Node],
        (data, a, ctx) => {
            // Framework runs fn once per settled wave.
            innerUnsub?.();  // previous cleanup fires via fn return (see below)
            innerUnsub = undefined;

            if (ctx.terminalDeps[0] === true) {
                sourceDone = true;
                if (!innerUnsub) a.down([[COMPLETE]]);
                // else: inner still active — wave closes without DATA emission.
                // For defensive correctness (sources that send [DIRTY, COMPLETE]):
                // a.down([[RESOLVED]]);
                return;
            }
            if (ctx.terminalDeps[0] !== undefined) {
                // Source errored — framework auto-forwards via autoError, OR
                // we forward explicitly if autoError is disabled.
                return;
            }

            if (!ctx.dataFrom[0]) {
                // Source sent RESOLVED — framework pre-fn-skip already handles
                // this case (fn never called). This branch is unreachable.
                return;
            }

            innerUnsub = forwardInner(fromAny(project(data[0] as T)), a, () => {
                innerUnsub = undefined;
                if (sourceDone) a.down([[COMPLETE]]);
            });

            // Cleanup returned to framework: called before next fn run.
            return () => { innerUnsub?.(); innerUnsub = undefined; };
        },
        {
            ...operatorOpts(opts),
            completeWhenDepsComplete: false,  // wait for inner
        }
    );
}
```

**Key insight on cleanup:** `node()` fn return is cleanup, not a DATA value (foundation
redesign §7). Returning `() => { innerUnsub?.() }` means the framework calls this cleanup
function before the next fn invocation. This replaces the `clearInner()` call at the top
of `attach()`.

### B's actual advantages vs A (corrected)

**Claimed in `docs/optimizations.md`:**
> "Wave batching — multiple outer DATAs in the same batch → fn runs once with the latest value."

**Correction:** This is NOT automatically provided by switching from producer to `node()`.
`_onDepMessage` processes messages one at a time. Each DIRTY→DATA pair is one wave. For N
DIRTY→DATA waves in one batch, fn runs N times, same as the producer runs `attach()` N times.
The "batch optimization" would require a framework-level wave-coalescing mechanism (not yet
implemented). See discussion in §"Framework-level batch optimization" below.

**Actual B advantages:**

| Benefit | Mechanism | Evidence |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Pre-fn skip on source RESOLVED | `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement` line 1279 | `if (!_waveHasNewData && !_hasNewTerminal && _hasCalledFnOnce)` → `_emit(RESOLVED_ONLY_BATCH)` — fn not called |
| Diamond coordination | source declared as dep | Framework tracks wave across all topology paths to `switchMap` |
| Equals substitution via `a.emit()` | `_frameBatch` → `_updateState` | `a.emit(v)` runs equals check; same value → DATA substituted with RESOLVED automatically |
| Clean terminal handling | `ctx.terminalDeps[]` | No manual COMPLETE/ERROR branching in subscribe callback |
| Cleanup as fn return | framework calls cleanup before next fn | Replaces manual `clearInner()` at top of attach |

**B obligations vs A:**

| Case | A | B |
|------|---|---|
| Source RESOLVED | `for` loop: no branch hit, silent | Pre-fn skip: fn not called, framework auto-emits RESOLVED — write nothing |
| Source DATA, inner same value | `a.emit(v)` → `_updateState` equals | Same — `a.emit(v)` handles it |
| Source DATA, inner new value | `a.emit(v)` | Same |
| Source COMPLETE, inner active | `sourceDone = true; return` | `sourceDone = true; return` (RESOLVED defensive for DIRTY+COMPLETE sources) |
| Source COMPLETE, no inner | `a.down([[COMPLETE]])` | `a.down([[COMPLETE]])` |
| Source ERROR | `clearInner(); a.down([ERROR])` | `ctx.terminalDeps[0]` is error payload; forward if `autoError` disabled |

### RESOLVED propagation in chains (critical invariant)

**Question:** In `A → B → C`, if A sends RESOLVED to B, does B forward RESOLVED to C,
or swallow it?

**Answer:** B MUST forward RESOLVED to C. Confirmed by code:

From `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement` (node.ts:1276–1283):
```typescript
// Pre-fn skip: when no dep sent DATA this wave (all RESOLVED), skip
// fn and emit RESOLVED directly. Transitive-skip optimization — leaf
// fn is not re-run when a mid-chain node produces the same value.
if (!this._waveHasNewData && !this._hasNewTerminal && this._hasCalledFnOnce) {
    this._clearWaveFlags();
    this._emit(RESOLVED_ONLY_BATCH);   // ← B emits RESOLVED to C
    this._maybeAutoTerminalAfterWave();
    return;
}
```

From `_depSettledAsResolved` (node.ts:1223–1228):
```typescript
private _depSettledAsResolved(dep: DepRecord): void {
    if (dep.dirty) {
        dep.dirty = false;
        this._dirtyDepCount--;
    }
    // Does NOT touch latestData, terminal, or sentinelDepCount.
    // A dep that was sentinel stays sentinel — RESOLVED ≠ DATA.
}
```

**Full wave trace for A→B→C when A's value doesn't change:**

```
Wave open:
  A emits DIRTY → B._onDepMessage(DIRTY) → _depDirtied → _dirtyDepCount=1
                   B emits DIRTY_ONLY_BATCH → C._onDepMessage(DIRTY) → same

Wave settle (A value unchanged):
  A emits RESOLVED → B._onDepMessage(RESOLVED) → _depSettledAsResolved → _dirtyDepCount=0
                     _maybeRunFnOnSettlement → !_waveHasNewData → pre-fn skip
                     B emits RESOLVED_ONLY_BATCH → C._onDepMessage(RESOLVED) → same
                     C pre-fn skip → C emits RESOLVED to its sinks
                     B's fn: not called
                     C's fn: not called
```

**Why this matters for B's correctness:** When source declares itself as a dep of switchMap (B),
and source sends RESOLVED, the pre-fn skip fires at the switchMap node and auto-emits RESOLVED.
This closes the downstream wave without any explicit `a.down([[RESOLVED]])` in fn. This is the
"write nothing" case confirmed.

**Critical invariant:** RESOLVED must propagate to close waves opened by DIRTY. A node that
swallows RESOLVED would leave downstream nodes stuck with `_dirtyDepCount > 0`, blocking all
future waves on those nodes permanently.

**Sentinel note:** `_depSettledAsResolved` does NOT decrement `_sentinelDepCount`. A dep that
has never emitted DATA and then emits RESOLVED stays sentinel. The node's first-run gate
remains closed. RESOLVED means "I ran but nothing changed" — it does not mean "I have a value."

## Framework-Level Batch Optimization Discussion

### What optimizations.md claims

> "Wave batching — multiple outer DATAs in the same batch → fn runs once with the latest value.
> Fewer inner subscription churn for switchMap."

### What actually happens today

`_onDepMessage` is called once per message in the subscribe callback's `for (const m of msgs)`
loop. Each DIRTY→DATA pair triggers fn independently. For N rapid outer values:

```
msgs = [DIRTY, DATA(1), DIRTY, DATA(2), DIRTY, DATA(3)]
→ _onDepMessage(DIRTY) → _depDirtied → _dirtyDepCount=1
→ _onDepMessage(DATA(1)) → _depSettledAsData → _dirtyDepCount=0 → fn fires, data[0]=1
→ _onDepMessage(DIRTY) → _depDirtied → _dirtyDepCount=1
→ _onDepMessage(DATA(2)) → _depSettledAsData → _dirtyDepCount=0 → fn fires, data[0]=2
→ _onDepMessage(DATA(3)) ...
```

fn fires 3 times. Same inner churn as A. The "wave batching" optimization is NOT provided
by simply using `node()` instead of `producer()`.

### What would be needed for true batch optimization

To achieve "N DATAs in one batch → fn runs once with latest," the framework would need
one of:

**(Option W1) Wave-coalescing in `_onDepMessage`:** When multiple DIRTY→DATA pairs for
the same dep arrive in one `msgs` delivery, skip intermediate fn runs and only run fn
after the last DATA. Requires the subscriber loop to look ahead before calling
`_maybeRunFnOnSettlement`.

**(Option W2) Two-phase batch delivery guarantees:** If the batch system guarantees that
all DIRTY signals for a wave are delivered before any DATA signals (phase-1 = DIRTY,
phase-2 = DATA), and if multiple DATAs from the same dep accumulate in phase-2, then
only the last DATA triggers fn. This would require the batch system to coalesce per-dep
DATA deliveries.

**(Option W3) Dep-level deduplication:** Before calling `_onDepMessage` for DATA, check
if the dep already has a pending DATA from this batch (dep is not dirty because it was
already settled). If so, update `latestData` and skip re-firing `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement`.

None of these are implemented today. The claim in `optimizations.md` should be revised to
reflect that B's advantages are pre-fn-skip (RESOLVED case) + diamond coordination +
equals substitution — not wave batching for multiple DATAs.

**This is a separate framework-level optimization** that should be filed under the
"Framework primitive: wave-final state for multi-dep derived" item in `optimizations.md`.

---

## Decision

**Lean B (fn+closure) for all `*Map` operators.**

Rationale:
1. Pre-fn skip on RESOLVED eliminates silent drops of RESOLVED from source
2. Diamond coordination is correct for any topology where source feeds both a `*Map` and
   other nodes
3. Equals substitution via `a.emit()` eliminates explicit RESOLVED obligations in the
   common DATA case
4. `ctx.terminalDeps` is cleaner than manual COMPLETE/ERROR branching in subscribe callback
5. Cleanup-as-fn-return replaces boilerplate `clearInner()` pattern

**Not a reason to use B:** wave batching for multiple outer DATAs in one batch. That's a
separate optimization.

**Risk:** fn must correctly handle the terminal wave case (source COMPLETE while inner active)
— emit `a.down([[RESOLVED]])` defensively if a DIRTY wave was opened. Needs stress testing.

---

## Remaining Wave 1 Walk-throughs (pending)

- `exhaustMap` — same producer pattern as switchMap; simpler (no inner switch, just gate)
- `concatMap` — queue management + forwardInner; review buffer overflow semantics
- `mergeMap` — fix BUG-1 first; then B upgrade
- `withLatestFrom` — already uses `node()` + batch model (updated); audit secondary-unsettled scenario
- `firstValueFrom` / `firstWhere` — fix BUG-2; audit COMPLETE-before-DATA; add `firstWhere` tests
- `forwardInner` — P3 reads; START handshake coverage; DIRTY forwarding correctness

---

## Batch Input Model Update (2026-04-13)

All `node()` usages across `operators.ts` and `sources.ts` were migrated
from the old scalar `data[i]` format to the new batch-per-dep format
(`data[i]: readonly unknown[] | undefined`). See SESSION-foundation-redesign.md §11
for the full spec.

### Strategy for auditing extras under batch model

**D1 Option B (2026-04-13):** Operators must iterate the **full batch**, not just `.at(-1)`.
Each value in `batch0` produces an independent downstream wave. `ctx.latestData[i]` is a
fallback for secondary/side-channel deps only — never use it for primary source values.

When walking through an operator that uses raw `node()`, check for:

1. **Primary source reads** — iterate the full batch; emit one downstream wave per value:
   ```ts
   const batch0 = data[0];
   if (batch0 == null || batch0.length === 0) { a.down([[RESOLVED]]); return; }
   let emitted = false;
   for (const v of batch0) {
       // operator logic...
       a.emit(processedV);
       emitted = true;
   }
   if (!emitted) a.down([[RESOLVED]]);
   ```
   For operators that always emit per value (tap, scan), omit the `emitted` guard.

2. **`ctx.dataFrom[i]` checks** (old API) — "did dep i emit DATA this wave?". Replace with:
   ```ts
   batch0 != null && batch0.length > 0   // dep emitted new DATA
   batch0 == null || batch0.length === 0  // dep did NOT emit new DATA
   ```

3. **Secondary dep (latest-only semantics)** — e.g. `withLatestFrom`'s secondary, `valve`'s control.
   Use `ctx.latestData[i]` for the latest scalar value. The primary batch drives iteration;
   each value pairs with the same latest secondary.

4. **Producer nodes (`node([], fn)`)** — never receive batch data (no deps), `data = []`.
   These are subscription-factory nodes; they subscribe to sources manually and call
   `actions.emit()` / `actions.down()` directly. No migration needed.

5. **`node(eventNodes, fn)` with dynamic-length deps** — iterate `data.length`, skip if
   `data[i] == null || data[i].length === 0`. See `cqrs.ts` saga for the idiom.

6. **Terminal-only operators** (reduce, last) — use `.at(-1)` for accumulation target but
   iterate for fold (`reduce`) or keep `.at(-1)` for tracking latest (`last`).

### Operators migrated in this session

All operators below were first migrated to batch format (`.at(-1)` extract), then upgraded
to D1 Option B (full batch iteration) in the same session.

| Operator | D1 Option B behavior |
|----------|---------------------|
| `filter` | iterate batch, emit each passing value; RESOLVED if none pass |
| `scan` | iterate batch, fold+emit after each value |
| `reduce` | iterate batch, fold all values (no emit until COMPLETE) |
| `take` | iterate batch, count+emit, COMPLETE when count reached |
| `skip` | iterate batch, skip first N, emit rest; RESOLVED if all skipped |
| `takeWhile` | iterate batch, emit while predicate holds, COMPLETE on first false |
| `last` | keeps `.at(-1)` — accumulates latest value until COMPLETE (correct) |
| `tap` (fn form) | iterate batch, call fn+emit each; RESOLVED if empty |
| `tap` (observer form) | iterate batch, call obs.data+emit each; RESOLVED if empty |
| `distinctUntilChanged` | iterate batch, emit only values differing from prev; RESOLVED if all suppressed |
| `pairwise` | iterate batch, form+emit pairs; RESOLVED until second value seen |
| `withLatestFrom` | iterate primary batch, pair each with `ctx.latestData[1]` |
| `valve` | iterate source batch when control open, emit each; RESOLVED if closed or empty |
| `forEach` (sources.ts) | iterate batch, call fn for each value |
| `toArray` (sources.ts) | iterate batch, push each value to buffer |
| `cqrs.ts` saga | skip dep if batch null/empty; use `batch.at(-1)` for event array |
| `reactive-layout.ts` segmentsNode | batch0/batch1 `.at(-1)` extract (one layout value per wave) |
| `reactive-block-layout.ts` measuredBlocksNode | batch0/batch1 `.at(-1)` extract |
| `orchestration.ts` loop fn | batch0/batch1 `.at(-1)` extract (loop control value) |
| `orchestration.ts` task | changed `run: NodeFn` → `run: DerivedFn<T>`, sugar-wrapped |

## *Map B Upgrade (2026-04-13) — DONE

All four `*Map` operators upgraded from producer pattern (A) to fn+closure (B) with source
declared as a dep. `forwardInner` OPEN-1 dead code removed. `mergeMap` BUG-1 + BUG-3 fixed
by replacing inline `spawn()` with `forwardInner`.

### Key findings during implementation

**Cleanup form must be `{ deactivation }`, not `() => void`:**  
`() => void` cleanup fires before every fn rerun (including terminal waves). This tears down
the active inner subscription before fn can check `innerUnsub` for the source COMPLETE case.
`{ deactivation }` fires only on node deactivation — inner subscription survives across fn
reruns so the terminal wave can inspect it.

**`_frameBatch` auto-framing resolves async inner concern:**  
When inner is a boundary source (`fromPromise`, `fromAsyncIter`), `forwardInner`'s callback
fires asynchronously. `_frameBatch` checks `_status !== "dirty"` before prefixing DIRTY, so
the dep-wave's DIRTY (status = "dirty") and the inner's eventual DATA pair up correctly.
No double-DIRTY, no stuck wave. Producer A's "atomic DIRTY+DATA" via `a.emit()` is
equivalent to B's "dep-wave DIRTY → later DATA settles it."

**COMPLETE settles dirty deps:**  
`_depSettledAsTerminal` clears `dep.dirty` and decrements `_dirtyDepCount`. Source COMPLETE
without prior DIRTY in the same batch does NOT propagate DIRTY from the switchMap node to its
sinks — so fn can return without emitting and no wave is stuck. No RESOLVED-before-COMPLETE
needed.

**`exhaustMap` RESOLVED for drops is correct:**  
Source is a declared dep → dep-wave propagates DIRTY downstream → fn must close the wave.
For drops (inner active), `a.down([[RESOLVED]])` settles the dep-wave. Test updated.

**Equals in multi-tier-3 batches (refined):**  
`_updateState` counts tier-3 messages (`tierOf(m[0]) === 3` — DATA and RESOLVED) in the batch.
When count > 1, equals checking is skipped entirely — downstream fn must run regardless. Only
single-tier-3 batches benefit from equals → RESOLVED substitution → pre-fn skip.

`this._cached` is updated inline per DATA (unchanged). Because `checkEquals` is false for
multi-tier-3 batches, equals is never called on intermediate values — no deferred write needed.
The temporary `newCache` approach was introduced and subsequently reverted: it caused an
INVALIDATE/TEARDOWN regression (deferred write overwrote cache clears), and was unnecessary
given `checkEquals` already gates equals out for multi-DATA batches.

### Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `operators.ts` `forwardInner` | Removed OPEN-1 dead post-subscribe `.status`/`.cache` reads |
| `operators.ts` `switchMap` | Producer A → fn+closure B, `{ deactivation }` cleanup |
| `operators.ts` `exhaustMap` | Producer A → fn+closure B, RESOLVED on drop, `{ deactivation }` cleanup |
| `operators.ts` `concatMap` | Producer A → fn+closure B, `{ deactivation }` cleanup |
| `operators.ts` `mergeMap` | Producer A → fn+closure B, `spawn()` replaced with `forwardInner` (fixes BUG-1 + BUG-3), `{ deactivation }` cleanup |
| `node.ts` `_updateState` | Skip equals for multi-tier-3 batches (`checkEquals = dataCount <= 1`); inline `_cached` write preserved |
| Tests | §3.5 equals tests updated (multi-DATA → no substitution), exhaustMap drop test updated |

### Resolved items

- ~~`docs/optimizations.md` — "Higher-order operators: fn+closure tier-1 upgrade"~~ **DONE**
- ~~`docs/optimizations.md` — "P3 audit #1: operators.ts:994 — forwardInner reads inner.cache"~~ **DONE** (OPEN-1 removed)
- ~~`SESSION-foundation-redesign.md` Flag E — P3 audit (forwardInner .cache as exception)~~ **DONE**
- ~~BUG-1: mergeMap inner ERROR leaks subscription~~ **DONE** (forwardInner handles ERROR correctly)
- ~~BUG-3: mergeMap forwards inner START tokens~~ **DONE** (forwardInner filters START)

### QA pass (2026-04-13) — additional fixes

Adversarial review and edge-case hunt found three issues and caught one regression:

| Finding | Location | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `mergeMap` `spawn()` TDZ crash — `const stop` accessed in closure before assignment if inner completes synchronously | `operators.ts` `spawn()` | Changed `const stop` → `let stop`, closure guard `if (stop)` |
| Closure state not reset on reactivation — `sourceDone = true` persists after deactivate, causes premature COMPLETE on re-subscribe | All four `*Map` operators | Added `sourceDone = false` to every `{ deactivation }` return |
| `newCache` deferred write overwrites INVALIDATE/TEARDOWN cache clears — `[INVALIDATE]` batch: `this._cached` was set to `NO_VALUE` then overwritten at end of loop | `node.ts` `_updateState` | Reverted `newCache` entirely; inline `_cached` write naturally avoids the regression since `checkEquals` already gates equals out for multi-tier-3 batches |

Post-QA follow-up (applied in same session):
- **C: switchMap batch optimization** — skip to last value in batch (`batch0[batch0.length - 1]`), call `clearInner()` once; N-1 intermediate `project()` calls eliminated
- **`forwardInner` inner signal filtering** — `else` branch narrowed to only DIRTY/RESOLVED; PAUSE, RESUME, TEARDOWN, INVALIDATE from inner all dropped (see rationale below)

Deferred (added to `docs/optimizations.md`): versioning for intermediate DATA in multi-DATA batch.

## PAUSE/RESUME, `up()`, and tier classification — design notes (2026-04-13)

### `up()` is a pure passthrough in derived nodes

```typescript
up(messages): void {
    for (const d of this._deps) {
        d.node.up?.(messages, forwardOpts);  // fans out to ALL declared deps
    }
}
```

`up()` does NOT consume the message at the *Map node. It fans out to every declared dep. For all four `*Map` operators, the only declared dep is `source`. So:

- Downstream `up([[PAUSE, lockId]])` → *Map's `up()` → `source.up([[PAUSE, lockId]])` — source is paused, stops producing. **The *Map node itself is NOT paused.**

### PAUSE/RESUME direction

| Direction | Path | Effect |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Source emits PAUSE downstream | `source → _onDepMessage → this._emit([[PAUSE]])` | *Map node IS paused (fn suppressed, `_pauseLocks` updated), PAUSE forwarded to *Map's sinks |
| Downstream `up([[PAUSE]])` | `downstream → *Map.up() → source.up()` | Source slows/stops production; *Map node NOT paused; existing inners continue |

Source PAUSE (downstream direction) suppresses fn and chains PAUSE to consumers — that is the full backpressure effect for stopping new outer waves. Existing inner subscriptions keep running; they're already in flight. For a hard output gate that silences ALL output including ongoing inners, use `valve`/`gate` instead.

### `forwardInner` is one-way; `up()` doesn't reach the inner

`forwardInner` is `inner.subscribe(callback)` — data flows inner → outer only. When downstream calls `up()`, it fans to declared deps (`source`), not to the inner node. The inner node is a private implementation detail managed via `innerUnsub`; it has no `up()` channel back from the outer node's consumers.

### Why inner INVALIDATE is dropped (same rationale as PAUSE/RESUME/TEARDOWN)

INVALIDATE from inner means "my cache is stale, I'll recompute." When the inner recomputes it'll emit DIRTY+DATA through `forwardInner` normally. Forwarding INVALIDATE to the outer output is redundant (DIRTY follows anyway) and wrong for mergeMap (one inner's cache state must not invalidate the entire merged output). The same "inner lifecycle is internal" principle applies.

Final `forwardInner` filter:
- START → drop (protocol, not data)
- DATA → `a.emit()`
- COMPLETE → `onInnerComplete()`
- ERROR → `a.down([m])` + cleanup
- DIRTY → `a.down([m])` (wave signal: inner changing, outer will change)
- RESOLVED → `a.down([m])` (wave signal: inner unchanged, wave closes)
- INVALIDATE, PAUSE, RESUME, TEARDOWN → **drop** (inner lifecycle/flow-control, internal to *Map)

### Are `*Map` operators tier 1?

Not fully. The tier classification is about runtime behavior, not just wiring style.

The `source → *Map` edge IS tier-1: declared dep, wave-tracked, equals optimization, diamond coordination apply. ✅

But every `*Map` operator creates a **second subscription** inside fn:
```
source ──(dep, framework-tracked)──▶ *Map node
                                          │
                                     project(v)
                                          │
                                    inner node ──(forwardInner.subscribe, manual)──▶ *Map node
```

The inner subscription is not a declared dep, not wave-tracked, can fire asynchronously, and is managed manually via `innerUnsub`. This is inherently tier-2 behavior.

**Accurate description:** *Map operators are "fn+closure tier-2" — tier-1 outer wiring (source dep is framework-tracked) + tier-2 inner management (inner subscription is manual). The upgrade brings tier-1 benefits (wave coordination, equals, diamond) to the outer dep while keeping the inner escape hatch.

A pure tier-1 switchMap would require `dynamicNode` (auto-tracks inner as a dep via cache reads), but that hits P3. Whether a dynamicNode-based approach is viable and worth the tradeoff is deferred to a separate session.

### Still open

> **Status revalidated 2026-04-17.**

- ~~`docs/optimizations.md` — "Framework primitive: wave-final state for multi-dep derived"~~ **RESOLVED** (`wave-final-state-primitive`).
- `dynamicNode`-based *Map approach — **still deferred** to a separate post-1.0 session.
- ~~10 pre-existing orchestration/ai/domain-templates test failures~~ **RESOLVED** — full suite is now 1641 passing, 0 skipped.

### Resolved in Wave 1 close-out (2026-04-13)

- ~~BUG-2: `firstValueFrom` / `firstWhere` — `queueMicrotask` replaced with `shouldUnsub` pattern~~ **DONE**
- ~~`firstWhere` zero test coverage~~ **DONE** — 4 scenarios added in `sources.test.ts`
- ~~`withLatestFrom` secondary-dep test gaps~~ **DONE** — 5 scenarios added in `operators.test.ts`:
  - Primary fires before secondary → no DATA (sentinel gate)
  - Secondary updates, primary fires → pairs with latest secondary
  - Secondary COMPLETE → operator continues, primary still emits frozen value
  - Secondary ERROR → propagates (requires primary already settled; sentinel gate swallows it otherwise — filed in `optimizations.md`)
  - Secondary COMPLETE without prior DATA → primary emission suppressed (RESOLVED)

**New finding:** `withLatestFrom` sentinel gate (`_sentinelDepCount > 0`) blocks `_maybeAutoTerminalAfterWave`, so secondary ERROR is silently swallowed when primary has never emitted. Filed in `docs/optimizations.md`. Tests document this constraint via comment.

- ~~`withLatestFrom` — secondary terminates before primary DATA (secondary-without-data guard)~~ **DONE** — `secondaryHasData` guard added (moved to `ctx.store` — closure variables survive resubscribable terminal reset, `ctx.store` is wiped on reset); fn suppresses emission (returns RESOLVED) when primary fires after secondary went terminal without ever emitting DATA.

### QA pass (2026-04-13) — additional fixes

- ~~**`toArray` — final-wave DATA dropped on same-wave DATA+COMPLETE**~~ **FIXED** — `sources.ts`. When a source emits DATA and COMPLETE in the same wave (e.g. `fromTimer` one-shot), both arrive in one fn invocation with `data[0]` populated AND `terminalDeps[0] === true`. The COMPLETE check ran before the `data[0]` accumulation loop, silently dropping the final value. Fixed by reordering: accumulate `data[0]` into `buf` first, then check `terminalDeps[0]`.

- ~~**`withLatestFrom` — `secondaryHasData` closure variable leaks across resubscribable reset**~~ **FIXED** — `operators.ts`. `secondaryHasData` was a closure variable that survived resubscribable terminal reset; after the secondary terminates and the operator resubscribes, `secondaryHasData` stayed `true` from the prior subscription, making the next primary emission pair with stale state. Fixed by moving to `ctx.store.secondaryHasData` (wiped on reset).

## Wave 2 (2026-04-14) — harness fast-retry + autoTrackNode regression

### Findings

**BUG-F1: `harnessLoop` fast-retry exhaustion — `item._retries` always `undefined`**

`totalRetries` reached `maxTotalRetries` (20) instead of `maxRetries` (2). Root cause: depth-first
delivery caused a diamond race in `verifyContext = withLatestFrom(verifyWithExec, executeInput)`.

Timeline when `retryTopic.publish(retryItem1)` fires:
1. `executeInput` emits `[DIRTY, DATA(retryItem1)]` to its sinks in subscription order: executeNode
   first (depth-first), then verifyNode (direct dep[1]), then verifyContext (direct dep[1]).
2. Because executeNode processes its full message batch before verifyNode does, executeNode runs its
   fn and emits `DATA(execOutput1)`. This synchronously chains through verifyNode → verifyWithExec →
   verifyContext. verifyContext fires with `batchData[1]=undefined` (executeInput hasn't reached its
   dep[1] yet) and falls back to `prevData[1]=M0` (original item). Item = M0, `_retries=undefined`.
3. `fastRetry` sees `item._retries=undefined` on every retry cycle → publishes retryItem with
   `_retries=1` every time → loops to the global cap.

**Fix (loop.ts):** Insert `executeContextNode = withLatestFrom(executeNode, executeInput)` between
execute and verify. This node fires exactly once per execute-wave: executeInput notifies executeNode
first (depth-first), executeNode settles in dep[0], then executeInput settles in dep[1] →
`dirtyDepCount` reaches 0 only after both. `verifyNode` now depends on `executeContextNode` alone
(single dep), so `verifyNode` fires once with the correct `[execOutput, item]` pair. `verifyContext
= withLatestFrom(verifyNode, executeContextNode)` samples executeContextNode as secondary — both
deps are in the same wave, executeContextNode settling last.

**BUG-F2: `signals-autotrack` — `level2` emits `undefined` after branch-switch when batching**

`multi-level conditional with grow-only dep sets` failed: after `useX.set(false)`, `seen` contained
`["x2#0", "undefined#0", "a2#0"]` instead of `["x2#0", "a2#0"]`.

Root cause (three-layer):

1. **Old `dynamicNode` vs new `autoTrackNode`**: the old `DynamicNodeImpl._downInternal` emitted
   DATA synchronously (no `downWithBatch` deferral). The new `autoTrackNode` wraps `NodeImpl` which
   uses `downWithBatch` — inside a batch/flush context, subscribe handshake DATA is deferred.

2. **Stale drainPhase2 closures**: inside `useX.set(false)` → batch → drainPhase2 flush, when
   `level1.get()` is called:
   - `pull(level1._node)` activates level1, subscriptions to `useA`/`a` queue deferred DATA in
     drainPhase2. `pull` immediately `unsub()`s → `_deactivate` → `resetDepRecord` (clears
     `dep.dirty`, `dep.prevData`, sets `dep.unsub=null`) → dep callbacks removed from useA/a sinks.
     But the drainPhase2 closures already captured the dep callback by value — they fire regardless.
   - `tracker(level1._node)` = `_addDep(level1._node)` resubscribes level1. `_activate` runs
     (`_dirtyDepCount=0` reset), subscribing to `useA`/`a` again — more deferred DATA queued.

3. **Premature fn run**: drainPhase2 fires the stale closures first. `_depSettledAsData(dep[0],
   true)` arrives. `dep[0].dirty=false` (reset) → no `dirtyDepCount--`. `dirtyDepCount=0` →
   `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement` → `_execFn`. `batchData[0]=[true]`, `batchData[1]=undefined`,
   `ctx.prevData[0]=undefined` (reset), `ctx.prevData[1]=undefined`. `track(a)` → falls through
   to `ctx.prevData[1]=undefined`. `result = true ? undefined : ...` = `undefined`. Emits
   `DATA(undefined)` → `level2=undefined` → `top="undefined#0"`.

**Fix (sugar.ts):** Added sentinel guard to `autoTrackNode`'s `wrappedFn` — mirrors `derived()`'s
existing guard. Before fn runs, if any known dep (in `depIndexMap`) has `ctx.prevData[idx] ===
undefined` AND `batchData[idx]` null/empty, emit RESOLVED and return. This blocks all premature
runs triggered by stale/partial closures. The guard is cleared once a dep's `prevData` is committed
(first DATA commit happens in `_execFn` pre-fn, unconditionally before fn runs).

**Guard safety analysis:**
- Only fires when `depIndexMap.size > 0` (known deps exist) — discovery runs (empty map) unaffected.
- `prevData[i]` is committed from `batchData[i]` BEFORE fn runs (in `_execFn`), so the guard opens
  for a dep immediately after its first DATA wave, even if fn emits RESOLVED.
- Matches `_sentinelDepCount` semantics for dynamic deps — equivalent to "wait for all known deps to
  have delivered at least one DATA before emitting a real value".
- Permanent block only if a dep truly never sends DATA — same behavior as `derived()` sentinel gate.
- All 1411 tests pass.

**Open question — alternative fix:** The guard is a correct workaround for stale drainPhase2
closures. The underlying cause is that `downWithBatch` captures sink callbacks by value, so
unsubscribing doesn't prevent deferred closures from firing. A more surgical fix would add a
generation counter to `DepRecord`:
```
// In _activate / _addDep:
dep.gen = (dep.gen ?? 0) + 1;
const capturedGen = dep.gen;
dep.unsub = dep.node.subscribe((msgs) => {
    if (dep.gen !== capturedGen) return; // stale closure
    ...
});
// resetDepRecord: dep.gen++ (invalidates all prior closures)
```
This would prevent stale closures from reaching `_depSettledAsData` at all. Deferred for now — all
tests pass with the guard, and the guard is logically equivalent to the old `_sentinelDepCount`
behavior for dynamic deps.

### Still open (Wave 2)

> **Status revalidated 2026-04-17.**

- Python parity — **intentionally deprioritized** per `docs/optimizations.md` line 7 (rigor infra Projects 1–3 first).
- ~~`docs/optimizations.md` — prevData open item~~ **RESOLVED** (`ctx-prevdata-rename`).
- Generation-counter fix for stale drainPhase2 closures (BUG-F2 alternative) — **still deferred**. Sentinel guard works; surgical alternative not blocking. Revisit if guard's "wait for known deps" semantic causes friction.

### Wave 3–5 status (revalidated 2026-04-17)

- **Wave 3 (resilience.ts / backpressure.ts / backoff.ts / timer.ts):** No formal per-file pass executed, but high-risk items closed via P3 audit (`fetch-count-cache-p3`) and `resilience-composition-parity`. Remaining items would be incremental.
- **Wave 4 (reactive data structures):** **Shipped** — all five structures (reactive-map, reactive-list, reactive-index, reactive-log, pubsub) refactored 2026-04-15 with version counter + lazy snapshot + `*Backend` interfaces + bulk APIs + stress tests. See `docs/optimizations.md` § "Reactive data structures (Wave 4 audit, 2026-04-15)".
- **Wave 5 (adapters.ts + worker/):** Partial — worker bridge P3 audits resolved (`worker-bridge-handshake-timer`, `worker-bridge-aggregator-p3`); HTTP adapters got `fromhttp-fetched-companion`. Per-protocol-family slice not formally executed. Wire-protocol Option B folded into post-1.0 "snapshot delivery" session.
