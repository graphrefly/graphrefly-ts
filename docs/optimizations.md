# Optimizations

`graphrefly-ts` currently prioritizes protocol correctness and phase-by-phase feature delivery. This document tracks built-in optimizations and concrete optimization opportunities in a format similar to callbag-recharge.

---

## Built-in optimizations

These are implemented in the current codebase.

### 1. Output slot model (`null -> single sink -> Set`)

Node subscriptions use a tiered storage model instead of eagerly allocating a `Set`:

- `null` when no downstream subscribers
- a single callback reference for one subscriber
- a `Set` only when fan-out exceeds one subscriber

This avoids unnecessary allocations in the common 0-1 subscriber case.

### 2. Batch phase split (`DIRTY` immediate, `DATA`/`RESOLVED` deferred)

`core.batch()` and `core.emitWithBatch()` preserve two-phase semantics while reducing redundant downstream work during grouped updates:

- non-phase-2 messages propagate immediately
- phase-2 messages flush once at outermost batch completion
- nested batch scopes share one deferred queue

### 3. Diamond settlement via integer bitmask

Nodes with multiple dependencies use integer bitmasks to track dirty/settled dependency state in each wave:

- `DIRTY` marks dependency bits
- `DATA`/`RESOLVED` settle bits
- recompute runs once when all dirty bits are settled

This gives glitch-free behavior with low overhead.

### 4. Lazy upstream connect/disconnect

Dependency subscriptions are attached on first downstream subscriber and released when the last downstream subscriber unsubscribes.

This keeps disconnected nodes lightweight while preserving cached values.

### 5. Single-dependency DIRTY skip

When a node has exactly one subscriber that is a single-dep node (detected via `subscribe(sink, { singleDep: true })`), DIRTY is filtered from emissions to sinks. The subscriber synthesizes dirty state locally. This halves inter-node dispatch calls in linear single-dep chains. Automatically disabled when fan-out occurs (second subscriber connects).

### 6. `>32` dependency segmented bitmask

Dirty/settled/completion tracking uses a `BitSet` abstraction: integer masks for ≤31 deps, segmented `Uint32Array` masks for >31 deps. Preserves O(1)-ish "all settled" checks at any fan-in width.

---

## Potential optimizations

These are not yet implemented, but are concrete and compatible with the current protocol.

### 1. (moved to built-in §5)

**Status:** Built-in
**Impact:** Medium-high in single-dep hot paths

When a node has exactly one subscriber and that subscriber declares itself as single-dep (via `subscribe(sink, { singleDep: true })`), the node filters DIRTY from emissions to sinks. The subscriber synthesizes dirty state locally via `onDepSettled → onDepDirty` when DATA arrives without prior DIRTY.

**Safety:** The optimization only activates when `sinkCount === 1 && singleDepSinkCount === 1`. With a single subscriber, no diamond can form from this node. When a second subscriber connects, the count increases and the optimization disables automatically. When it drops back to one single-dep subscriber, it re-engages.

**How it works (inspired by callbag-recharge):**

- `subscribe(sink, { singleDep: true })` — subscriber hints that it has exactly one dep with `fn`
- Source tracks `singleDepSinkCount`; when sole subscriber is single-dep, DIRTY is filtered from `down()` emissions to sinks (local status still updates via `handleLocalLifecycle`)
- Consumer's `onDepSettled` already calls `onDepDirty` when DATA arrives without prior dirty bit — this synthesizes DIRTY locally before recomputing

### 2. >32 dependency fallback for bitmask tracking

**Status:** Built-in
**Impact:** Medium for high-fan-in nodes

Dirty/settled/completion tracking uses a `BitSet` abstraction: integer masks for ≤31 deps, segmented `Uint32Array` masks for >31 deps. Preserves O(1)-ish "all settled" checks at any fan-in width.

### 3. Optional production-time debug stripping

**Status:** Not implemented  
**Impact:** Low-medium (bundle + minor runtime)  
**Priority:** Low

As observability/debug hooks are added, a build-time stripped entry point could remove debug-only branches for production.

---

## Open design decisions (needs product/spec call)

These came out of QA review; behavior is **not** “wrong” until aligned with `docs/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md` and roadmap intent.

### A. `COMPLETE` when all dependencies complete

**Current behavior:** A node with dependencies and a compute `fn` may emit `[[COMPLETE]]` when **every** upstream dependency has emitted `COMPLETE`.

**Spec note:** `GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md` §1.3.5 states that **effect** nodes complete when all deps complete — it does not necessarily require the same rule for derived/operator-style nodes.

**Decision needed:** Should auto-completion apply only to side-effect nodes (`fn` returns nothing), always, never, or behind an explicit option (e.g. `completeWhenDepsComplete`)?

### B. More than 31 dependencies

**Resolved.** Bitmask tracking now uses a `BitSet` abstraction that falls back to segmented `Uint32Array` for >31 deps (see Built-in §5 / Potential §2).

## Deferred follow-ups (QA)

Non-blocking items tracked for later; not optimizations per se.

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **`lastDepValues` + `Object.is`** | Skips `fn` when dep snapshots are referentially equal. Fine for immutable values; misleading if deps are mutated in place. |
| **`sideEffects: false` in `package.json`** | Safe while the library has no import-time side effects. Revisit if global registration or polyfills are added at module load. |
| **JSDoc on `node()` / public types** | `docs/docs-guidance.md`: add JSDoc on new public exports. |
| **Roadmap §0.3 checkboxes** | Mark Phase 0.3 items when the team agrees the milestone is complete. |
