## Deviations from plan (recorded 2026-04-28)

The Tier 8 and Tier 9.1 batches departed from the original plan text in several places. Each is recorded below for posterity. The categories follow the format the /qa retrospective uses (A = approved during planning, B = implementation slip caught by /qa, C = forced collision-resolution).

### A — Approved during planning via 9-question lock
- **A1 — γ-0 framework change (`MutationOpts.audit?` optional).** Plan §Tier 8 originally required new audit log surfaces on Cluster II messaging sites. γ-0 collapsed that requirement. Final: messaging sites route through `lightMutation` with `audit` omitted. ✅ Legitimate (cognitive-load reduction, two-layer separation preserved).
- **A2 — `cqrs.saga` uses `lightMutation`, not `wrapMutation`.** Plan §Tier 8 row 6 said `wrapMutation`. Final: `lightMutation`. Rationale: per-event batch frames would change saga's wave timing; `errorPolicy: "advance"` is the canonical rollback model already.
- **A3 — `process/start` + `process/cancel` deferred entirely.** Plan §Tier 8 rows 7–8 said `wrapMutation`. Final: γ-7-B (lightMutation-wrap `appendRecord` only; full `wrapMutation` migration deferred to optimizations.md). Rationale: wrapMutation would silently change failure semantics (synthetic-event-emit error → "failed start"); pre-1.0 break warrants a deliberate consumer-driven decision.
- **A4 — `resilientPipeline` lives in `extra/resilience/`, not `ai/presets/`.** Consolidation plan classified it as ai preset; final γ-R-2 places it semantically with the resilience family. Reach via `@graphrefly/graphrefly/extra`. Rationale: not AI-specific; foreshadows Tier 9.2 `classifyError` neighbor.
- **A5 — `inspect()` Q5-6 medium scope.** Consolidation plan said `inspect()` composes `explainPath + auditTrail + health + flow + why + policyGate`. Final ships medium: `lens + auditTrail + explainTarget + complianceSnapshot()`, no `policyGate`. Rationale: `policyGate` is control-plane (denies/audits writes), conceptually distinct from observation; bundling would conflate inspection with enforcement.

(A had 6 entries in an earlier draft of this section — the `EvalResult` → `EvalRunResult` rename was mistakenly listed as A6. It was discovered mid-implementation via a DTS build error, NOT during planning, so it belongs solely in C. Removed from A; recorded only as C1 below.)

### B — Implementation slips caught and corrected by /qa (2026-04-28 Tier 9.1 pass)
- **B1 — Lens nodes initially `add()`ed directly to InspectGraph** (TEARDOWN broadcast through `_nodes` invalidated externally-held lens subscriptions); JSDoc claimed otherwise. **Corrected** via D1: lens lives in a child `LensSubgraph` mounted at `lens::*`. TEARDOWN cascades via `_destroyClearOnly` (no broadcast).
- **B2 — `mapFromSnapshot` defensive helper deleted in Tier 10.1.** Live emit path is always a `Map`, but `JsonGraphCodec` round-trips `Map` as plain `{}` on snapshot-restore. Without the helper, downstream `.entries()` / `.size` accesses silently fail. **Corrected** via D2: helper restored at `extra/composite.ts` and parallel `instanceof Map` check added at `ai/adapters/core/capabilities.ts`. Cleanup-tier safety checklist added to [docs/docs-guidance.md](docs/docs-guidance.md) so future Tier 10.x cleanups verify both live-emit AND snapshot-restore paths.
- **B3 — `process/start` initial γ-7-B used `freeze: false`.** Copied from memory-primitive precedent (where 768-dim vector freeze is a real tax). Process state objects are tiny — `freeze: false` opened a post-record state-mutation hazard. **Corrected** via D4: `freeze: true`. Migration shape-preservation rule added to docs-guidance.
- **B4 — Saga `aggregateId` conditional spread.** Initial migration "tightened" `{ aggregateId: ev.aggregateId }` (always-present, possibly undefined) to `...(ev.aggregateId !== undefined ? ... : {})` (key absent when undefined). Silently changes `Object.hasOwn` semantics + JSON serialization shape. **Corrected** via D5: restored always-include-key.
- **B5 — `processManager` lacked pre-flight name-collision detection** (γ-7-B added a `registerCursor` mount on top of the existing audit-log mount; second-construction throws cryptic `Graph.add` "node already exists"). **Corrected** via D3: pre-flight `cqrsGraph.tryResolve` check throws a process-manager-specific error message.

### C — Forced collision resolution
- **C1 — `bridge.ts` `EvalResult` → `EvalRunResult` rename.** Tier 9.1 reorg merged audit/lens/guarded-execution into `inspect/`; refine-loop moved into `harness/presets/`. After both moves, `harness/index.ts` re-exported both `bridge.ts.EvalResult` (eval-runner shape: `{run_id, model, tasks}`) AND refine-loop's `EvalResult` (per-task scoring shape: `{taskId, score, candidateIndex}`) under the same name, causing a DTS-time collision. Bridge's variant had narrower blast radius (5 file-local references vs 30+ for refine-loop's), so it was renamed. The two types are domain-distinct and shouldn't have shared the name pre-merge either; the reorg just surfaced the latent collision.

## Deviations from polish + /qa pass (recorded 2026-04-28)

The 2026-04-28 polish batch (initial 4-batch sweep) and follow-up /qa pass departed from initial plan in several places. Categories follow the same A/B/C taxonomy as the Tier 8 / Tier 9.1 logs above.

### A — Approved during planning (deliberate scope changes)
- **A1 — Batch A scope downgrade from "implement signal plumbing" to "audit + add regression tests."** The optimizations.md entry (opened 2026-04-28) said the work was mechanical plumbing; audit during Phase 1 recon revealed every shipped provider already plumbed `LLMInvokeOptions.signal` correctly through to `fetch(..., { signal })` / SDK `{ signal }` calls. Re-doing already-correct work would have been worse than wasted; locking the contract via tests is the right move. ✅ Legitimate.
- **A2 — Tier 6.6 / 6.7 regression tests skipped in Batch B.** Verified during recon that `prompt_node::response` lifecycle (Tier 6.6) and gatedStream timing keepalive (Tier 6.7) both already have dedicated regression tests in `phase5-llm-composition.test.ts` and `ai.test.ts`. ✅ Legitimate.

### B — Implementation slips caught and corrected by /qa
- **B1 — Bundled 3-way verdict test (verified/retry/structural) timed out and was downgraded to a single-branch structural-publish test.** Initial attempt with mockLLM response cycling + 3-item interleaving + retry-attempt timing was flaky under both 5s and 15s timeouts. Per-branch coverage exists in three separate tests already. Bundled test deferred to `optimizations.md` "QA follow-ups from polish-batch /qa pass" entry pending a deterministic-timing mock primitive. **Partially legitimate** — coverage of the individual branches is preserved; cross-branch routing-confusion regressions could still escape until the bundled test lands.
- **B2 — `AuditTrailGraph.includeTypes` JSDoc/freeze mismatch + module-singleton sharing.** Initial implementation claimed "Frozen at construction" without `Object.freeze`, AND default-using instances reused the module-level `DEFAULT_INCLUDE_TYPES` Set across all instances. **Corrected** via P1: clone defaults per-instance; JSDoc tightened to drop the false claim and document the `ReadonlySet`-only mutation contract.
- **B3 — Tier 6.2 foreign-node-accept test had tautological assertions** (`chain.steps.length >= 0`, `expect(ndTopic.latest).toBeDefined()`). **Corrected** via P2: identity-equality check + describe-walk dep verification. Side benefit: surfaced that `describe()`'s `nodeToPath` canonicalizes the foreign node back to the hub's first-registration path — a stronger assertion than what the original test attempted.
- **B4 — Tier 6.5 reflect-tick test bound `[verdicts.length, verdicts.length + 2]` was loose enough to absorb a 1-tick over-count regression.** **Corrected** via P3: tightened ceiling to `+1`.
- **B5 — Tier 6.4 structural verdict test only checked `some(r => r.verified === false)`.** A regression publishing both a structural AND a stray verified verdict for the same item would have passed the existential check. **Corrected** via P4: added count assertions (exactly 1 structural, 0 verified).
- **B6 — `bumpCursor` warning message ("snapshot codec round-tripped...") was misleading for first-bump-with-bad-seed case** (e.g. developer-error `state<number>(NaN)`). **Corrected** via P5: generalized message to cover both root causes.
- **B7 — EH-9 regression test fixture used a user-named node (`__internal__/helper`)** rather than driving the real `graph.ts:1959` transitive-walk synthesis path. The original wasn't *wrong* — just incomplete (covered the prefix-filter contract only). **Corrected** via P6: added a second test that constructs an unregistered unnamed dep and verifies (a) the synthetic path actually appears in describe under `__internal__/N`, and (b) real orphans still surface alongside.

### C — Forced collision resolution
- **C1 — `sentinelState` test asserted `s.status === "data"` after `.emit(42)`** but the runtime's actual post-DATA status is `"settled"` per the `NodeStatus` union (`core/node.ts:94`). Pure runtime-contract miss; corrected to `"settled"`. (Subsequently moot: `sentinelState` was removed during the deviation-audit pass per A3 below.)
- **C2 — Tier 6.2 fixed test asserted gate's deps contained `gates::needs-decision/gate/source`** but `describe()`'s `nodeToPath` resolves to the canonical hub path `queues::needs-decision::latest`. Corrected the assertion AND tightened the surrounding comment to document the canonicalization. The corrected assertion is a stronger lock (a wrapper-node regression would surface as a distinct intermediate path, not the hub canonical path).

### A — Approved during planning, second pass (deviation-audit follow-up, 2026-04-28)
- **A3 — `sentinelState<T>()` factory removed pre-1.0 in favor of `state<T>()` zero-arg overload.** The polish-batch /qa pass landed `sentinelState<T>()` as new sugar for the "no value yet" pattern (replacing `state<T>(undefined as unknown as T)` casts). The deviation audit identified the API as a redundant sibling to `state<T>(initial?: T)` once the latter accepts an optional initial. Per `feedback_no_backward_compat` (pre-1.0, no legacy shims), `sentinelState` was removed; `state<T>()` overload became the canonical sentinel-form sugar. Migration: the 2 test sites that briefly used `sentinelState` were retargeted to `state<T>()`; `sentinelState.md` API doc moved to `TRASH/`. ✅ Legitimate — applies the no-backward-compat policy directly.

### Systemic improvements landed alongside the /qa fixes
- [docs/docs-guidance.md](docs/docs-guidance.md) gained two new sections: "Cleanup-tier safety checklist" (verify both live-emit and snapshot-restore paths before deleting defensive runtime guards) and "Migration shape preservation" (record/object-shape changes during behavior-preserving migrations require explicit user lock).
- Memory `feedback_no_autonomous_decisions.md` updated with shape-preservation guidance and concrete examples (saga aggregateId, process freeze).

## Tier 1 — Remaining foundational design

### 1.1 §1.4 spec amendment (INVALIDATE-at-diamond coalescing) ✅ landed (verified 2026-04-27)
- **Source:** optimizations.md (2026-04-23)
- **Status:** Already in spec at [GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md §1.4 lines 185–207](~/src/graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md). Two paragraphs cover the rule:
  - "INVALIDATE delivery is idempotent within a wave" — fan-in coalescing.
  - "Never-populated case" — first-time INVALIDATE at unsettled mid-chain derived is a no-op.
- **Action:** mark optimizations.md entry resolved.

### 1.2 Session C — `promptNode` switchMap sentinel handling ✅ locked 2026-04-27 (L2 revised 2026-04-30)
- **Source:** AI/harness audit Unit 1 ([SESSION-ai-harness-module-review.md:223](archive/docs/SESSION-ai-harness-module-review.md:223)) + reverted-rewrite root cause ([line 3654](archive/docs/SESSION-ai-harness-module-review.md:3654)).
- **Lock summary:** Path (b) producer-based confirmed. Topology: `prompt_node::messages` (derived, `meta.ai = "prompt_node::messages"`) → `prompt_node::output` (switchMap product, `meta.ai = "prompt_node::output"`). Per-wave inner: `prompt_node::response` (producer wrapping `fromAny(adapter.invoke(msgs)).subscribe(...)`, `meta.ai = "prompt_node::response"`). Empty-msgs branch dispatches `state<T|null>(null)`. Abort via `nodeSignal(opts.abort)` + `AbortController`.
- **Decisions locked (L1–L9):**
  - **L1** — Path (b) producer-based is the official design. Path (a) `derived + filter/distinctUntilChanged` rejected: derived's first-run gate leaks transient nulls; filter doesn't address the secondary 20-retry race observed in the reverted attempt.
  - **L2 (revised 2026-04-30 in C+D widening)** — Inner-node naming `::response` (was `::call`). Aligned with Unit 1 Q8 D-path naming and `meta.ai.kind = "prompt_node::response"`. Messages-node `meta.ai.kind = "prompt_node::messages"` (was `"prompt_node"`). Output naming unchanged. Inner is still a producer (path (b)) — no topology change.
  - **L3** — Empty-msgs branch keeps `state<T|null>(null)`. Push-on-subscribe semantics emit the mid-flow drop-out signal exactly once.
  - **L4** — Initial-no-input (SENTINEL, no emission) vs mid-flow no-input (emits `null`) distinction is load-bearing for `withLatestFrom`-paired triggers; keep.
  - **L5** — Forward-unknown for non-DATA/ERROR/COMPLETE messages via `actions.down([msg as never])` per spec §1.3.6.
  - **L6** — Cross-wave cache stickiness (§32) is a consumer concern. `promptNode` stays primitive; JSDoc cross-link to §32 required in Tier 6.6.
  - **L7** — JSON-parse failure emits `[ERROR, wrapped]` + terminates inner. "Retry on invalid JSON" is downstream (verifier stage or `withRetry` policy on adapter).
  - **L8** — Acceptance gate: `harness.test.ts` retry/reingestion/queue-depth stay green AND add isolated unit test ("N upstream dep waves → exactly N DATAs on `prompt_node::output`, zero transient nulls, zero coalesce loss") to `phase5-llm-composition.test.ts` or new `prompt-node.test.ts`.
  - **L9** — Tier 6.6 reduced scope: JSDoc additions (§32 cross-link + middleware recipe), L8 unit test, resolution of the open `prompt_node::response`-in-`describe()` visibility question. No topology change.
- **Unblocks:** Tier 6.6.

## Tier 1.5 — Graph-module API additions (locked via Session A)

These extend the public surface of `Graph`. Land before Tier 5 (Wave B blocks consume them) and ideally before Tier 2 reorg lands so the consolidation diffs cover the new entry points.

### 1.5.1 `describe` topology layer (Session A.1 lock)
- **✅ Reactive diff variant landed (2026-04-27):** `describe({ reactive: "diff" }): ReactiveDescribeHandle<DescribeChangeset>` — wired in [graph.ts](src/graph/graph.ts), backed by `_describeReactiveDiff` which wraps the existing snapshot stream and emits diffs via `topologyDiff` from [extra/composition/topology-diff.ts](src/extra/composition/topology-diff.ts). Initial cache is a synthetic full-add diff. Empty changesets suppressed. Snapshot variant (`reactive: true`) unchanged.
- **✅ `format` option removal landed (2026-04-27, Tier 2.1 A2; renamed 2026-04-30 D1):** `describe({ format })` dropped; consumers compose `derived([describe({ reactive: true })], ([g]) => graphSpecToMermaid(g))` using the pure renderers in `extra/render/`. The 2026-04-30 D1 follow-up renamed the public functions from `to*` to `graphSpecTo*` (e.g. `toMermaid` → `graphSpecToMermaid`, `toAscii` → `graphSpecToAscii`) so the input type is explicit at the call site.
- **Diff envelope:**
  ```ts
  type DescribeChangeset = { events: ReadonlyArray<DescribeEvent>; flushedAt_ns: number };
  type DescribeEvent =
    | { type: "node-added";        path: string; node: DescribeNodeOutput }
    | { type: "node-removed";      path: string }
    | { type: "node-meta-changed"; path: string; prevMeta: Meta; nextMeta: Meta }
    | { type: "edge-added";        from: string; to: string }
    | { type: "edge-removed";      from: string; to: string }
    | { type: "subgraph-mounted";  path: string }
    | { type: "subgraph-unmounted"; path: string };
  ```
  No overlap with `ObserveEvent`. Topology-only.
- **Internal helper:** `topologyDiff(prev: GraphDescribeOutput, next: GraphDescribeOutput): DescribeChangeset` — pure function, used by `describe({ reactive: "diff" })` internally; re-exported from `extra/composition/topology-diff.ts` for static-snapshot diffing.

### 1.5.2 `observe` data layer (Session A.2 + A.4 lock)
- **✅ Reactive variant landed (2026-04-27):** `observe({ reactive: true }): Node<ObserveChangeset>` — both single-path and all-paths overloads. Wired via `_observeReactive` in [graph.ts](src/graph/graph.ts) using a producer-bound structured observer + `registerBatchFlushHook` coalescer. Cleanup is producer-lifecycle bound (last unsubscribe tears down the inner observer).
- **Envelope landed:**
  ```ts
  type ObserveChangeset = { events: ReadonlyArray<ObserveEvent>; flushedAt_ns: number };
  ```
  Each event carries `event.path`.
- **✅ `tiers` option (reactive variant) landed:** `ObserveOptions.tiers?: readonly ObserveTier[]` filters before accumulation. `ObserveTier = ObserveEvent["type"]` exported. Default = all.
- **✅ `tiers` for the structured-callback variant landed (2026-04-27):** filter applied at the central `recordEvent` funnel in `_createObserveResult` — out-of-scope events are dropped before they hit the events buffer, the listener fan-out (onEvent), the async iterable, and the format logger. One insertion point covers all surfaces.
- **Callback API unchanged.**

### 1.5.3 `GraphSpec ≡ GraphDescribeOutput` unification (Session A.1 lock) — Phase 1 ✅ landed (2026-04-27)

**Three-phase plan** (D1–D5 picks: phase 1 2 3 / d2 a / d3 b / d4 go / d5 renames).

#### Phase 1 ✅ — substrate (landed 2026-04-27)
- **`detail: "spec"` projection** — added in [core/meta.ts](src/core/meta.ts) `resolveDescribeFields`; projects `type` / `deps` / `meta` (which carries `factory` / `factoryArgs`) and strips `status` / `value` / `lastMutation` / `guard`.
- **`factoryTag(name, args?)` helper** — exported from [core/meta.ts](src/core/meta.ts) and re-exported from [core/index.ts](src/core/index.ts). Returns `{ factory, factoryArgs? }` — factories spread it into their `meta` option at construction time.
- **`compileSpec` dual-read** — [graphspec/index.ts](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) `normalizeSpec` runs at the top of `compileSpec`. Nodes with `meta.factory` get normalized into the legacy `fn` / `source` / `config` field-form so the rest of the compile pipeline works unchanged. Legacy fields take precedence when both forms set (explicit specs win).
- **`decompileSpec` rename (D5)** — [graphspec/index.ts](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) exports `decompileSpec` as a thin alias for `decompileGraph`. Phase 3 will retire the old name.
- **Tests** — new [spec-roundtrip.test.ts](src/__tests__/graphspec/spec-roundtrip.test.ts) covers projection, helper, dual-read, legacy precedence, and a full decompile→compile round-trip on a factoryTag-stamped graph. 10/10 green.
- **D2 (a)** locked: catalog stays `{ fns, sources }` — `meta.factory` populates whichever side fits the node type (producer → source; else fn).
- **State node `initial` gap noted** — `detail: "spec"` strips `value`, but state nodes need `initial` for re-creation. Phase 1 path: `decompileSpec` (delegating to `decompileGraph`) preserves `initial` from `value`. Phase 3 will resolve more cleanly via state factories tagging themselves with `factoryTag("state", { initial })`, OR retaining `value` in the spec projection for state-typed nodes.

#### Phase 2 — factory self-tagging migration (in progress)

Tag load-bearing factories so their constructed nodes carry `meta.factory` + `meta.factoryArgs`. Mechanical: each factory that produces a user-facing named node spreads `factoryTag(name, opts)` into its `meta` option.

**Tagged so far (✅ landed 2026-04-27):**
- [resilience.ts](src/extra/resilience.ts): `rateLimiter`, `timeout`, `retry` (sanitized factoryArgs — preset name only, function form omitted via `retryFactoryArgs` helper).
- [operators.ts](src/extra/operators.ts): `scan` (tagged with `{ initial }`), `distinctUntilChanged`, `merge` (both empty-source and N-source branches), `switchMap`, `debounce` (`{ ms }`), `throttle` (`{ ms, leading, trailing }`), `bufferTime` (`{ ms }`). Function-typed args (project, equality, predicate) intentionally omitted.
- [frozen-context.ts](src/patterns/ai/prompts/frozen-context.ts): `frozenContext` (both single-shot and refresh-trigger branches; `factoryArgs: { name }` only when caller supplies one — non-serializable `refreshTrigger` omitted, merged into existing `aiMeta(...)`).
- All verified via 12 new `it()` blocks in [spec-roundtrip.test.ts](src/__tests__/graphspec/spec-roundtrip.test.ts) Phase 2 suite (22 total). 2390 tests passing.

**Phase 2 single-node operator mop-up ✅ landed (2026-04-27, parallel batch):**
- [operators.ts](src/extra/operators.ts): `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (with `{ initial: seed }`), `take` (both `count <= 0` and normal branches, with `{ count }`), `tap` (both function and observer forms), `withLatestFrom`. Function-typed args (project, predicate, reducer, observer) intentionally omitted from factoryArgs.
- 6 new regression tests appended to [spec-roundtrip.test.ts](src/__tests__/graphspec/spec-roundtrip.test.ts) "Phase 2 operator mop-up" suite.
- Skipped: `takeWhile`, `takeUntil`, `buffer` (function/Node args, lower priority — defer).

*Bundle factories — primary-node-tag pattern decision needed (DG3):*
- `verifiable` ([composite.ts:56](src/extra/composite.ts:56)) — tag the `verified` companion or wrap the source coercion node
- `withStatus` ([resilience.ts:807](src/extra/resilience.ts:807)) — tag `out` (the wrapping node)
- `withBreaker` ([resilience.ts:511](src/extra/resilience.ts:511)) — same pattern

*Skip (non-node return / non-serializable args):*
- `circuitBreaker` (line 393) — returns object, not node
- `fallback` (line 941) — `fb` can be Node/Promise/AsyncIterable (non-JSON)
- `tokenBucket` (line 598) — returns TokenBucket object

**Phase 2.5 — Graph-factory tagging (DG1=B, DG2=ii, DG3=no, DG4=now) — substrate ✅ landed (2026-04-27)**

Substrate:
- [GraphOptions](src/graph/graph.ts) — added `factory?: string` + `factoryArgs?: unknown` (constructor stores them).
- [GraphDescribeOutput](src/graph/graph.ts) — added top-level `factory?` + `factoryArgs?` so `describe()` surfaces provenance.
- [Graph.prototype.tagFactory](src/graph/graph.ts) — fluent mutator for post-construction tagging from inside Graph-returning factories.
- [placeholderArgs](src/core/meta.ts) helper — recursive walker substitutes `"<function>"` / `"<Node>"` / `"<unserializable>"` for non-JSON fields per DG2=ii. Re-exported from [core/index.ts](src/core/index.ts).
- [GraphSpec.factory](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) + [GraphSpecCatalog.graphFactories](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) — new `GraphFactory = (factoryArgs: unknown) => Graph` type. `compileSpec` early-dispatches when `spec.factory` matches a `catalog.graphFactories` entry; otherwise falls through to per-node compile (graceful fallback).

Flagship migration:
- [pipelineGraph](src/patterns/orchestration/pipeline-graph.ts) tagged via `g.tagFactory("pipelineGraph", tagArgs)` (constructor opts spread, with `factory`/`factoryArgs` keys excluded from the recursive nesting).

Tests (7 new in spec-roundtrip.test.ts):
- `tagFactory()` surfaces in `describe()` (default detail) and `describe({ detail: "spec" })`.
- `GraphOptions.factory` constructor seeding.
- `placeholderArgs` recursive walker (function → `"<function>"`, Node → `"<Node>"`, primitives kept).
- `compileSpec` delegates to `catalog.graphFactories[name]` when matched.
- `compileSpec` falls back to per-node compile when no match.
- `pipelineGraph` self-tags correctly.

**Phase 2.5 mop-up ✅ landed (2026-04-27, parallel batch + agents):**
- [agent-memory.ts:173](src/patterns/ai/memory/agent-memory.ts:173) `agentMemory` — tags inner Graph; `placeholderArgs` over opts (adapter / extractFn / score / cost / embedFn / entityFn / callbacks).
- [harness/loop.ts:838](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:838) `harnessLoop` — tags `HarnessGraph`; `placeholderArgs`.
- [agents/agent-loop.ts:750](src/patterns/ai/agents/agent-loop.ts:750) `agentLoop` — tags `AgentLoopGraph`; `placeholderArgs`.
- [cqrs/index.ts](src/patterns/cqrs/index.ts) `cqrs` — tags `CqrsGraph`; `placeholderArgs` (note: public factory is `cqrs`, not `cqrsGraph`).
- [job-queue/index.ts:562](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:562) `jobFlow` — tags `JobFlowGraph`; `placeholderArgs` over `{ stages: [{ work: "<function>", ... }], ... }`.
- [orchestration/pipeline-graph.ts:583](src/patterns/orchestration/pipeline-graph.ts:583) `pipelineGraph` (flagship) — already landed substrate-side.
- 7 new regression tests across `factory-tags-memory-harness.test.ts` (3) + `factory-tags-orchestration.test.ts` (3) + the existing flagship test in `spec-roundtrip.test.ts`.

**QA pass landed (2026-04-27, post-Phase-2.5 mop-up):** 14 of 25 reviewer findings patched in-batch (F1 decompile preserves top-level factory; F2 `_observeReactive` drains push-on-subscribe events; F3 tier filter applies to counters; F4 `compileSpec` validates before early-dispatch; F5 strip runtime sibling keys at decompile; F6 `placeholderArgs` cycle guard via WeakSet; F7 `placeholderArgs` getter-side-effect safety via try/catch; F8 `tagFactory` always-resets factoryArgs; F9 agent-memory closure-mirror unsub registered via `graph.addDisposer`; F10 `_describeReactiveDiff` settles `diffNode` with TEARDOWN on dispose; F11 `topologyDiff` actually shallow-copies node entries; F12 `_observeReactive` redundant tier filter dropped; F13 `pipelineGraph` routes opts through `placeholderArgs`; F14 `normalizeSpecNode` strips `meta.factory` when legacy fields took precedence). 11 deferred items tracked in `docs/optimizations.md`. 2417 tests passing.

**Skipped at Graph-level + bundle-tagging design session (DT1–DT5 — locked 2026-04-27):**

*Bundle factories — DT1=B (tag primary node), DT2=table-picks (landed alongside this batch):*
- `verifiable` → tag `bundle.verified` (the verification-result node, not the source coercion).
- `withStatus` → tag the wrapping output node.
- `withBreaker` → tag the wrapping output node.
- `distill` → tag `bundle.compact` (the user-facing budgeted memory view).
- `gatedStream` → tag `bundle.output` (the gate-released stream).
- `streamingPromptNode` → tag `bundle.output` (the accumulated text).
- `handoff`, `toolSelector` → tag the returned Node.

*Plain-object factories — DT3=A (skip + JSDoc note as "library helper, not in graph topology"):*
- `processManager` ([process/index.ts](src/patterns/process/index.ts)) — returns `ProcessManagerResult<TState>` (object with `instances`/`start`/`cancel`/`getState`); not in graph topology.
- `circuitBreaker`, `tokenBucket` ([extra/resilience.ts](src/extra/resilience.ts)) — return non-Node objects; their consumers (e.g., adapter stacks) carry provenance via their own factoryTag.

*Other:*
- `fallback` — DT4 = tag with name only (no factoryArgs since `fb` arg is non-JSON).
- `harnessGraph` — no separate factory; class is constructed only via `harnessLoop` (already tagged).
- `policyEnforcer` — DT5 (revised) = **defer tagging to Tier 2.3**, where the rename to `policyGate` lands. Tagging with the soon-to-be-deprecated name would create rename churn (every `meta.factory === "policyEnforcer"` matcher breaks at rename).
- `reactiveExplainPath` — `@deprecated`, will be removed pre-1.0; do not tag.

#### Phase 3 ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
- **Type collapse:** `GraphSpec = Omit<GraphDescribeOutput, "nodes" | "expand"> & { nodes: Record<string, DescribeNodeOutput | GraphSpecTemplateRef>; templates?; feedback? }`. `GraphSpecNode = DescribeNodeOutput`. The legacy field-form (`fn` / `source` / `config` / `initial`) is gone from the type — every node carries factory provenance in `meta.factory` / `meta.factoryArgs`. Top-level `factory?` / `factoryArgs?` ride through from `GraphDescribeOutput` for Graph-level tags.
- **`normalizeSpec` deleted.** `compileSpec` reads `meta.factory` / `meta.factoryArgs` directly via two helpers (`readFactory`, `readFactoryArgs`). The graphFactories early-dispatch is now a typed read on `spec.factory`. Catalog-aware validation (`validateSpecAgainstCatalog`) and `specDiff` were updated to read the meta-form instead of legacy fields.
- **`decompileSpec`** is a thin projection over `graph.describe({ detail: "spec" })`. Strips meta-companion paths, bridge / feedback-effect internals, and known runtime-state sibling keys (`status`, `breakerState`, `sourceVersion`). Adds a small feedback-edge recovery scan over `meta.feedbackFrom` / `meta.feedbackTo` (≈10 lines, the only post-process sugar). **Removed:** template fingerprinting / `_templateName` recovery — mounted subgraphs now appear as nested `subname::*` paths in the spec; round-tripping templates via `decompileSpec` is no longer in scope (file follow-up if a consumer needs it).
- **`decompileGraph` removed** as a public export. `decompileSpec` is the only name.
- **State `initial` resolution — path (b) lock:** `describe({ detail: "spec" })` retains `value` for state nodes only (gated by a new `specMode` parameter on `describeNode`). Derived/effect/producer values are still stripped. `compileSpec` reads state initial from `meta.factoryArgs.initial` first (for users who explicitly tag) then falls back to `node.value`. Path (a) was attempted (state self-tag via `factoryTag("state", { initial })`) but reverted because it spawned `<name>::__meta__::factory` + `<name>::__meta__::factoryArgs` companion nodes on every state, which broke `graphLens`-style nodeCount tests across the suite.
- **Consumer migrations:** [src/__tests__/patterns/graphspec.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/graphspec.test.ts) (full rewrite), [src/__tests__/patterns/surface/surface.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/surface/surface.test.ts), [src/__tests__/patterns/ai.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/ai.test.ts), [src/__tests__/evals/portable-catalog.test.ts](src/__tests__/evals/portable-catalog.test.ts), [src/__tests__/evals/prompt-template-validity.test.ts](src/__tests__/evals/prompt-template-validity.test.ts), [src/__tests__/graphspec/spec-roundtrip.test.ts](src/__tests__/graphspec/spec-roundtrip.test.ts) (Phase 3 suite expanded), [evals/lib/portable-templates.ts](evals/lib/portable-templates.ts), [evals/portable-eval-prompts.md](evals/portable-eval-prompts.md) (LLM-facing schema description + 3 example specs), [src/patterns/surface/index.ts](src/patterns/surface/index.ts) (decompileGraph reference removed).
- **LLM prompt:** `LLM_COMPOSE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in [src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) now teaches the unified shape (`meta.factory` / `meta.factoryArgs` instead of `fn` / `source` / `config`). State seed via `value` field (or `meta.factoryArgs.initial`).
- **Tests/lint/build:** 2419 tests passing, lint clean (no new warnings on touched files), build green.
- **Audit C24-2 (Tier 10.4) obsolete** — decompile is no longer approximate.

### 1.5.4 distill `extractFn` reactive form (Session A.5 lock) ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
- **New signature landed:** `extractFn: (raw: Node<TRaw>, existing: Node<ReadonlyMap<string, TMem>>) => NodeInput<Extraction<TMem>>` in [composite.ts:166](src/extra/composite.ts:166). Distill calls extractFn ONCE at wiring time and consumes the returned reactive stream. Internal `switchMap` removed; user controls cancellation / queueing semantics.
- **Single shape**, no callback overload (pre-1.0, breaking).
- **Consumer migrated:** [agent-memory.ts](src/patterns/ai/memory/agent-memory.ts) — `rawExtractFn` (still callback-style at the public API surface) wrapped in a closure-mirror + `switchMap` adapter that conforms to the new distill shape. Existing callback API on `AgentMemoryOptions.extractFn` preserved for downstream consumers; only the internal hand-off changed.
- **Test sites migrated:** [composite.test.ts](src/__tests__/extra/composite.test.ts) — 6 distill call sites updated to `(rawNode) => derived([rawNode], ([raw]) => ({ ... }))` for sync transforms. 10/10 tests green.
- **COMPOSITION-GUIDE §40 added:** [~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md](~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md) — cancel-on-new-input recipe, operator comparison table (switchMap / concat / mergeMap / derived), closure-mirror rationale (avoids `withLatestFrom` push-on-subscribe hazard per §32), sync-transform shortcut.
- **Note:** `consolidate` callback still callback-style; lock did not migrate it. Closure-mirror for `latestStore` retained inside distill solely for consolidate.
- **`llmExtractor` / `llmConsolidator`** (Wave AM AM.0) are unchanged — they return `(raw, existing) => NodeInput` callbacks that consumers wrap. Their internal shape doesn't need migration.

### 1.5.5 Functions-layer convention (Session A.3 lock) ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
- COMPOSITION-GUIDE §39 "Function identity via meta — fn-id convention" added in [~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md](~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md). Documents caller-stamped `meta.fnId("extractor::v1")` convention, naming format, why factory-implicit IDs aren't viable (closure state breaks naive hashing), and pairing with §37 handler-version audit (per-record vs per-node identity).

---

## Tier 1.6 — Naming + outcome conventions (locked 2026-04-27)

Doc + light-migration locks for path-separator naming and data-level outcome/status enums. Naming is observation-of-existing-practice (no code migration); enum migrations ride along with Tier 2.3.

### 1.6.1 Path-separator convention
- **`::`** — compound-factory internals: one factory ships multiple sub-nodes that operate as a unit; `meta.ai.kind` matchers and `describe()` pretty-rendering use the prefix. Examples: [prompt-node.ts:142](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-node.ts:142) `prompt_node::messages` / `::response` / `::output`; [reduction/index.ts:118](src/patterns/reduction/index.ts:118) `${stage}::input` / `::output`; [suggest-strategy.ts:209](src/patterns/ai/graph-integration/suggest-strategy.ts:209) `suggestStrategy::call`.
- **`/`** — namespace / domain grouping for independent nodes. Examples: [demo-shell/index.ts:120](src/patterns/demo-shell/index.ts:120) `pane/main-ratio`, `viewport/width`, `graph/mermaid`, `hover/target`.
- **Doc target:** new §38 "Naming conventions" in `~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md`. No code migration — current usage already conforms.

### 1.6.2 Outcome enum (action result, data-level — distinct from protocol COMPLETE/ERROR)
- **Canonical:** `outcome: "success" | "failure" | "partial"`.
- **Already canonical:** `harness/types.ts`, `harness/actuator-executor.ts`, `harness/refine-executor.ts`, `harness/loop.ts`.
- **Migrate:**
  - [cqrs/index.ts:130, 148](src/patterns/cqrs/index.ts:130) — `status: "success" | "failed"` → `outcome: "success" | "failure"` (rename field; `"partial"` n/a)
  - [process/index.ts:63](src/patterns/process/index.ts:63) — step `kind: "ok" | "fail"` → `outcome: "success" | "failure"`
- **Lands with:** Tier 2.3 pre-1.0 renames.

### 1.6.3 Status enum (lifecycle — long-running things)
- **Canonical:** `status: "running" | "completed" | "errored" | "cancelled"`. Past-participle `errored` pairs with `completed`.
- **Migrate:**
  - [pipeline-graph.ts:96](src/patterns/orchestration/pipeline-graph.ts:96) terminal cause: `kind: "complete" | "error"` → `kind: "completed" | "errored"; error?: unknown`
  - [resilient-pipeline/index.ts:80](src/patterns/resilient-pipeline/index.ts:80) — `"active"` → `"running"`; `"pending"` retained (distinct from running).
  - [process/index.ts:110](src/patterns/process/index.ts:110) — `"failed"` → `"errored"`; `"terminated"` and `"compensated"` retained as documented domain-specific extensions.
  - [core/config.ts:185](src/core/config.ts:185) and [_invariants.ts:3298](src/__tests__/properties/_invariants.ts:3298) — already aligned ✓.
- **Lands with:** Tier 2.3 pre-1.0 renames.

---

## Tier 2 — Structural reorganization

### 2.1 Consolidation Phase 1 — `extra/` folder split + renderer extraction ✅ landed (2026-04-27, parallel agent batch)

**A1 — extra/ folder split** (commit `fd2734a`, 52 files): four mega-files (`operators.ts` 2,664 LOC, `sources.ts` 1,327 LOC, `adapters.ts` 4,594 LOC, `resilience.ts` 1,091 LOC) physically moved into category folders (`operators/`, `sources/`, `io/`, `resilience/`, `data-structures/`, `storage/`, `composition/`). Top-level paths kept as thin re-export shims so consumer imports keep working. **Note (deviation from plan):** physical mega-file relocation only — the further per-category sub-file split inside each folder (e.g. `operators/{transform,take,combine,...}.ts`) is **deferred to a follow-up batch**. Sub-files exist as discoverable barrels but the canonical body still lives in `<folder>/index.ts`. This preserves zero-risk semantics for all internal cross-references and lets the per-protocol split (esp. `io/` which contains ~25 protocol adapters: Kafka/Redis/NATS/RabbitMQ/Pulsar/MCP/OTel/Syslog/StatsD/Prometheus/ClickHouse/S3/Postgres/MongoDB/Loki/Tempo/SQLite/Prisma/Drizzle/Kysely/CSV/NDJSON/file-sinks) happen as a separate, easier-to-review batch.

**A2 — Renderer extraction + `format` drop** (commit `f3b9b63`, 20 files; renamed 2026-04-30 D1): pure renderers extracted to new `src/extra/render/*` (dedicated subpath `@graphrefly/graphrefly/extra/render` — large strings shouldn't pull the full extra surface). `Graph.describe({ format })` overloads + dispatch removed; consumers compose `describe → derived(graphSpecToMermaid)` for live formatted output. `_layout-sugiyama.ts` / `_ascii-grid.ts` / `_ascii-width.ts` moved alongside `graph-spec-to-ascii.ts`. 5 in-tree consumers migrated. **D1 rename (2026-04-30):** the original `to*` names (`toMermaid` / `toAscii` / `toD2` / `toPretty` / `toJson` / `toMermaidUrl`) were renamed to `graphSpecTo*` (`graphSpecToMermaid` / `graphSpecToAscii` / `graphSpecToD2` / `graphSpecToPretty` / `graphSpecToJson` / `graphSpecToMermaidUrl`) for explicit input typing. File names match (`to-mermaid.ts` → `graph-spec-to-mermaid.ts` etc.). All in-tree callers, examples, website docs, and test fixtures migrated.

`assertBrowserSafeBundles` green. 2419 tests passing.

### 2.2 Consolidation Phase 2 — promotions to `extra/` ✅ landed (2026-04-27, Wave 2A)

Mutation framework (`lightMutation` / `wrapMutation` / `BaseAuditRecord` / `createAuditLog` / `tryIncrementBounded` and supporting `bumpCursor` / `appendAudit` / `registerCursor*`) relocated from `patterns/_internal/imperative-audit.ts` to `src/extra/mutation/index.ts`; `domainMeta` to `src/extra/meta.ts` (re-exported through the main `extra/` barrel); `decay` to `src/extra/utils/decay.ts` (re-exported on the barrel, no longer surfaced on `patterns.memory`); `budgetGate` (+ `BudgetConstraint` / `BudgetGateOptions`) to `src/extra/resilience/budget-gate.ts` joining the rest of the resilience family. `keepalive` consumers now import directly from its canonical home (`extra/sources.js`); the prior `_internal` re-export was dropped. `patterns/_internal/` retains only `emitToMeta` + `trackingKey` per consolidation plan §1. Test file moved from `__tests__/patterns/_internal/imperative-audit.test.ts` to `__tests__/extra/mutation/mutation.test.ts`. `assertBrowserSafeBundles` green; 2419 tests pass.

### 2.3 Consolidation Phase 3 — pre-1.0 renames + enum migrations ✅ landed (2026-04-27, Wave 2A)

Renames: `pipeline.gate(...)` → `pipeline.approvalGate(...)` (orchestration; `meta.orchestration_type` is now `approval_gate`); `policyEnforcer` / `PolicyEnforcerGraph` / `PolicyEnforcerOptions` → `policyGate` / `PolicyGateGraph` / `PolicyGateOptions` (audit). `policyGate` self-tags via `g.tagFactory("policyGate", placeholderArgs(opts))` per the Phase 2.5 DT5 ride-along; regression covered by new `__tests__/graphspec/factory-tags-audit.test.ts` (2 tests, mirrors the `factory-tags-orchestration.test.ts` shape).

Deletions: `lightCollection` folded into `collection({ ranked: false })` — `CollectionOptions` gains a `ranked?: boolean` flag (default `true`); when `false`, the timer / scoring / `ranked` derived are skipped (`ranked` becomes a static empty-array node) and the entries are pure LRU + audit. `LightCollection*` types removed; `CollectionGraph` gains `hasNode(id)` for parity. `fromLLM` (+ `FromLLMOptions`) deleted; `promptNode` gained `format: "raw"` (emits the full `LLMResponse`) plus a `tools` option to subsume the prior shape. `effectivenessTracker` (+ entry/snapshot/bundle types) demoted from `patterns/reduction` to `patterns/harness/effectiveness-tracker.ts` — its only consumer was the harness strategy model.

Enum migrations: `DispatchRecord.status` / `SagaInvocation.status` (`"success" | "failed"`) → `outcome` (`"success" | "failure"`) in `patterns/cqrs`. `ProcessStepResult` `kind: "fail"` → `kind: "failure"` in `patterns/process`. `TerminalCause.kind` and `CatchOptions.on` (`"complete" | "error"`) → `"completed" | "errored"` in `patterns/orchestration/pipeline-graph` (variant structure preserved — `errored` carries `error: unknown`). `extra/resilience` `StatusValue`: `"active"` → `"running"`. `ProcessInstance.status`: `"failed"` → `"errored"` (`"terminated"` and `"compensated"` retained as documented domain-specific extensions).

Test sites updated: `cqrs.test.ts` (3 assertions on `outcome`), `process.test.ts` (2 `kind: "failure"` returns + 1 `status === "errored"` assertion), `orchestration.test.ts` (2 `cause.kind === "errored"` assertions), `resilient-pipeline.test.ts` + `extra/resilience.test.ts` + `sources.http.test.ts` (`"running"` status assertions). `memory.test.ts` rewritten to drive the `lightCollection` block through `collection({ranked:false})`; `exports.test.ts` updated to drop `lightCollection` from the memory namespace check; `ai.test.ts` `fromLLM` block rewritten to use `promptNode({format: "raw"})`.

`assertBrowserSafeBundles` green; 2421 tests pass (added 2 from `factory-tags-audit.test.ts`); lint stays at the 9-warning baseline.

---

## Tier 3 — Audit prerequisites for Wave B (D.2 cluster) ✅ landed (2026-04-27, Wave 2B parallel-agent batch)

All five units landed via 3 parallel agents (A: 3.1+3.2 bundled, B: 3.3, C: 3.4+3.5 bundled). Each agent's worktree branched from main (pre-Tier-2.1) so changes were ported onto current branch state with file-path migration (`extra/resilience.ts` → `extra/resilience/index.ts`, `patterns/reduction/index.ts::budgetGate` → `extra/resilience/budget-gate.ts`) and symbol-name reconciliation (`policyEnforcer` → `policyGate`, `StatusValue: "active"` → `"running"`).

### 3.1 D.2.3a — supervisors cluster (`retry`, `circuitBreaker`, `timeout`, `fallback`) ✅ landed
- ✅ `retry({ backoff })` without explicit `count` throws `RangeError`.
- ✅ Source/factory-mode dedup via shared `_runRetryStateMachine` helper (~94 LOC saved; close to ~110 audit estimate).
- ✅ Centralized `resolveRetryConfig` for footgun-guard parity across both modes.
- ✅ JSDoc on clock injection contract.
- **Unblocks:** Unit 7 `resilientPipeline` rebuild.

### 3.2 D.2.3b — throttles & status cluster (`rateLimiter`, `tokenBucket`, `withStatus`) ✅ landed
- ✅ `rateLimiter` without explicit `maxBuffer` throws `RangeError`; `Infinity` opts in to unbounded.
- ✅ `RingBuffer` from `extra/utils/ring-buffer.js` backs the pending queue.
- ✅ `rateLimiter` return widened from `Node<T>` to `{ node: Node<T>, droppedCount: Node<number> }` companion bundle.
- ✅ `tokenBucket(capacity, refill, opts?)` accepts `clock?` for deterministic testability.
- ✅ JSDoc on `tokenBucket.tokens` float behavior, `withStatus` producer-pattern visibility, lifecycle (`"pending" | "running" | "completed" | "errored"` post-Wave-2A `StatusValue`).
- **Consumer update:** `resilient-pipeline` defaults `maxBuffer: Infinity` to preserve historical behavior.
- **Unblocks:** Unit 7 `resilientPipeline` rebuild.

### 3.3 D.2.4 — `budgetGate` ✅ landed
- ✅ Private `HeadIndexQueue<T>` (O(1) push, O(1) shift, opportunistic compaction) replaces `buffer.slice(1)` O(N²) drain. **Note:** chose `HeadIndexQueue` over `RingBuffer` because RingBuffer's drop-oldest eviction would silently lose buffered DATA between PAUSE and RESUME — that breaks budgetGate's backpressure contract. Documented in JSDoc.
- ✅ Terminal force-flush + PAUSE-release ordering: confirmed correct, documented as 4 explicit invariants in JSDoc with cross-links to COMPOSITION-GUIDE §19, §9/§9a, §24.
- ✅ JSDoc on `node([], fn)` producer-pattern (source invisible to describe-traversal).
- ✅ `@throws RangeError` on empty constraints; regression test asserts `instanceof RangeError`.
- ✅ Reference-equality semantics on `constraints` array documented (captured at construction; Architecture-2: compositor-only).
- 5 new tests in `reduction.test.ts` (terminal flush before COMPLETE/ERROR; PAUSE→RESUME FIFO ordering; 5000-item scaling regression; deferred RESOLVED).
- **Unblocks:** Unit 7 `resilientPipeline` rebuild.

### 3.4 D.2.1 — `policyGate` (renamed per Wave 2A 2.3) ✅ landed
- ✅ Reactive `paths: readonly string[] | Node<readonly string[]>` via closure-mirror + Set-diff rebind (mirrors the existing `policies: ... | Node<...>` pattern in same constructor).
- ✅ Reactive `violationsLimit` explicitly NOT added — deferral noted in JSDoc pointing to Tier 10.8 (TopicGraph reactive `retainedLimit`).
- ✅ 4 new reactive-paths test cases + 1 `placeholderArgs(Node<readonly string[]>) → "<Node>"` regression in `spec-roundtrip.test.ts`.
- **Unblocks:** Unit 6 `guardedExecution` rebuild.

### 3.5 D.2.2 — `Graph.explain` reactive opts + delete deprecated `reactiveExplainPath` ✅ landed
- ✅ `Graph.explain(from, to, opts)` widened: `from: string | Node<string>`, `to: string | Node<string>`, `opts.maxDepth?: number | Node<number>`, `opts.findCycle?: boolean | Node<boolean>`. Resolution helpers `isExplainArgNode` + `resolveExplainPath/Number/Boolean` mirror `isActorNode`. `_explainReactive` subscribes to reactive args via the existing `bump()` coalescer.
- ✅ Deprecated `reactiveExplainPath` deleted from `patterns/audit`. 6 call-site migrations: `patterns/lens.why`, audit test, `examples/knowledge-graph`, `demos/.../inspect.ts`, README, website demo pages, roadmap entry. Generated API doc removed (moved to `TRASH/`).
- ✅ Deletion regression test in `audit.test.ts` asserts `auditModule.reactiveExplainPath === undefined`.
- ✅ Patterns/lens `LensGraph.why` migrated to `target.explain(from, to, { reactive: true, ...opts })`.
- File path-scoped observe deferred (Tier 10.8 design follow-up — whole-graph observe is a perf gap, not a spec violation).
- **Unblocks:** Unit 8 `graphLens` rebuild.

---

## Tier 4 — Wave A + Wave AM memory primitive rebuilds ✅ landed (Wave A in Tier 2A; Wave AM closed 2026-04-27; markup reconciled 2026-04-28 in Tier 9.1 batch)

High-impact: memory is one of the public-face blocks. All LOCKED in public-face audit §F.

### 4.1 Wave A Unit 1 — `decay` utility ✅ landed
Pure 12-LOC function lives at [extra/utils/decay.ts](src/extra/utils/decay.ts) (Tier 2.2 promotion). Re-exported through `extra/index.ts`.

### 4.2 Wave A Unit 2 — `collection` (folds in old `lightCollection`) ✅ landed
`collection({ ranked: false })` is the "light" mode per consolidation Rule 4. `LightCollection*` types deleted in Wave 2A 2.3; `CollectionGraph` gained `hasNode(id)` for parity. `lightMutation` + `events` audit log adopted at [memory/index.ts](src/patterns/memory/index.ts).

### 4.3 Wave A Units 3–5 — `vectorIndex`, `knowledgeGraph`, full `collection` ✅ landed
All three primitives in [memory/index.ts](src/patterns/memory/index.ts) adopt `lightMutation` + per-primitive `events` audit logs. Distinct index types stay separate per consolidation Rule 4. `searchNode` / `relatedNode` reactive read APIs exposed; no imperative reads on Phase-4 primitives.

### 4.4 Wave AM Unit 1 — `tiers.ts` ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
`DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE` (`Math.LN2 / (7 × 86_400)` — 7-day half-life) extracted from [patterns/ai/memory/tiers.ts](src/patterns/ai/memory/tiers.ts) to [extra/utils/decay.ts](src/extra/utils/decay.ts) so any consumer (memory primitives, harness strategy decay, future routing-weight decay) can share the canonical default without reaching across domains. `tiers.ts` re-exports the const for backward-compat with existing `patterns/ai/memory/` consumers. Promoted alongside the existing `decay()` helper (already in `extra/utils/decay.ts` per Tier 2.2). `extractStoreMap` carry: handled separately in Tier 4.7.

### 4.5 Wave AM Unit 3 — `retrieval.ts` rename ripple ✅ landed
`pathOf` / `pathWeight` / `query.path` / `entry.path` renamed to `contextOf` / `contextWeight` / `query.context` / `entry.context` at [ai/memory/retrieval.ts:39](src/patterns/ai/memory/retrieval.ts:39). Unit 6 (`agent-memory.ts`) ripple folded into the same migration.

### 4.6 Wave AM Unit 4 — `llm-memory.ts` → `prompt-call.ts` ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
Public `promptCall<TIn, TOut>(systemPrompt, buildUserContent, opts, defaultName)` shipped at [src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-call.ts](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-call.ts), promoted from the previously-private `llmJsonCall` in `patterns/ai/memory/llm-memory.ts`. `PromptCallOptions` exported (was `LLMExtractorOptions`'s shared core). `llmExtractor` / `llmConsolidator` now thin wrappers over `promptCall` (logic unchanged). Internal consumer ([agent-memory.ts](src/patterns/ai/memory/agent-memory.ts)) migrated to import from `../prompts/prompt-call.js`. Top-level `patterns/ai/index.ts` now re-exports from `./prompts/prompt-call.js` directly. New `promptCall.md` API doc generated. **`patterns/ai/memory/llm-memory.ts` was retained as a re-export shim during the initial Tier 4.6 land but moved to `TRASH/` immediately after** (per `feedback_no_backward_compat` — pre-1.0 we don't keep legacy shims; all in-tree consumers were already migrated). See [TRASH-FILES.md](TRASH-FILES.md) for the canonical record. The "migrate to reactive `extractFn` per Tier 1.5.4" lock was already satisfied at Tier 1.5.4 land — `llmExtractor`/`llmConsolidator` produce callbacks consumed by distill, and Tier 1.5.4 wrapped that callback in a closure-mirror + switchMap adapter.

### 4.7 Wave AM Unit 5 — `memory-composers.ts` ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
Private `extractStoreMap<TMem>(snapshot: unknown): ReadonlyMap<string, TMem>` helper deleted from [memory-composers.ts](src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts). Replaced with inline typed cast `((snapshot as ReadonlyMap<string, TMem> | undefined) ?? new Map<string, TMem>())` at the 6 call sites — the runtime `instanceof Map` check was paranoid (post-Tier-1.5.4 the upstream `ReactiveMapBundle` always emits a Map). Empty map remains the canonical "no entries yet" fallback so deriveds/effects clear their first-run gate cleanly. Distill-consumer migration to reactive `extractFn` already landed in Tier 1.5.4 — `agent-memory.ts`'s closure-mirror + switchMap adapter wraps the callback-style extractor under the new `extractFn(rawNode, existingNode) => NodeInput<Extraction<TMem>>` shape; `memory-composers.ts` itself doesn't call `distill()` directly (it consumes an existing `DistillBundle`), so no migration needed at this site. **Carry NOT done in this batch:** the plan's "narrow upstream type" lock (eliminate the inline casts via a typed-derived variant) is filed in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) "Tier 4.7 follow-up — narrow `ReactiveMapBundle.entries` callback typing" and deferred until a second pattern-layer surface needs the same shape.

---

## Tier 5 — Wave B public-face block rebuilds

Three of the six public-face blocks. Each gates a high-visibility README claim.

### 5.1 Unit 6 — `guardedExecution` ✅ landed (2026-04-27, qa-revised 2026-04-28)
Rewrite of [guarded-execution/index.ts](src/patterns/guarded-execution/index.ts):
- `actor: Actor | Node<Actor>` (Tier 5.1 B.1 revision — pre-1.0 breaking; widened from static `Actor`). Caller-supplied `Node<Actor>` is bridged through a `derived([actorOpt], ([a]) => a ?? null, { initial: null })` adapter (qa G1B / EC2 fix) so the internal `_actorNode: Node<Actor | null>` always carries non-sentinel cache and downstream `derived`s (like `scope`) never stall on the SENTINEL first-run gate.
- **Canonical `wrapper.scopedDescribe: Node<GraphDescribeOutput>` mounted property** (qa G1A "same concept" / EC1 fix) — single reactive describe handle bound at construction to the configured actor, lifecycle owned by the wrapper. No per-call leak. Mounted under `scopedDescribe` in `describe()`.
- **Per-call escape hatch `scopedDescribeNode(actorOverride?, opts?): {node, dispose}`** — retained for the rare per-call-override case. Each call instantiates a fresh `target.describe({reactive: true})` handle; caller manages `dispose()`. Wrapper still tracks the dispose as a safety net for `wrapper.destroy()`.
- Imperative `scopedDescribe(opts)` (the pre-rewrite imperative method) dropped per the no-imperative-reads policy.
- Constructor throws `RangeError` on `mode:"enforce"` + static empty `policies` (deny-by-default misconfig).
- `lints: TopicGraph<GuardedExecutionLint>` mounted as `${name}::lints`. Each lint kind (`"empty-policies"` / `"audit-no-effect"` / `"no-actor"`) fires at most once per instance via `_firedLintKinds` guard. Reactive callers see `empty-policies` on the first DATA emit of an empty `policies` Node in enforce mode; `audit-no-effect` on construction when `mode:"audit"` + target has no per-node guards (one-shot — late-mounted guards leave the lint stale; reactive-recompute follow-up filed); `no-actor` on construction when no default actor configured.
- `scope: Node<{actor: Actor | null, mode, policiesCount}>` mounted at `scope` for dashboards. Re-emits when policies update or the actor Node swaps. `actor: null` for the no-actor case (state-of-`null` was used over `state(undefined)` to keep the derived's first-run gate satisfied — undefined is the v5 SENTINEL and would never push DATA).
- `domainMeta("guarded", "scope")` tagging on the scope derived.
- Tests (`__tests__/patterns/guarded-execution.test.ts`): 26 cases covering write enforcement / audit mode / `wrapper.scopedDescribe` (mounted property) / `scopedDescribeNode` (per-call escape hatch) / SENTINEL-bridge for caller-supplied Node<Actor> / per-call actor override / detail pass-through / RangeError on static empty / one-time `empty-policies` lint / `audit` tolerates empty / `audit-no-effect` / `no-actor` / `scope` reactivity / `domainMeta` describe assertion / dispose-idempotent. All green.
**Depends on:** Tier 3.4 (D.2.1 policyGate), Tier 2.3 (`policyEnforcer` → `policyGate` rename), Tier 1.5.1 (describe-reactive + actor-Node widening).

### 5.2 Unit 7 — `resilientPipeline` ✅ landed (2026-04-27)
Rewrite of [resilient-pipeline/index.ts](src/patterns/resilient-pipeline/index.ts):
- `resilientPipeline(...)` returns a `ResilientPipelineGraph<T>` (Graph subclass) instead of a bundle. Mounted intermediates (`rateLimited`, `budgetGated`, `breakerWrapped`, `timeoutWrapped`, `retryWrapped`, `fallbackWrapped`) appear in `pipeline.describe()` so the resilience chain shows up in topology snapshots, mermaid renders, and `lens.health` aggregations.
- Bundle properties → readonly graph properties: `output: Node<T>`, `status: Node<StatusValue>`, `lastError: Node<unknown | null>`, `breakerState: Node<CircuitState> | undefined`, `droppedCount: Node<number> | undefined`, `rateLimitState: Node<RateLimiterState> | undefined`. **Naming deviation from audit Wave-B Unit 7 §A:** the audit named the first two `node` / `error`, but `Graph.node(name)` and `Graph.error(name, err)` already name methods on the base class — readonly fields with those names would shadow the base methods. `output` / `lastError` are the smallest name change that preserves the underlying companion semantics.
- `NodeOrValue<T> = T | Node<T>` — `rateLimit` / `budget` / `breaker` / `retry` / `timeoutMs` accept either shape (precedent-aligned with `FallbackInput<T>`). **qa G1C-prime (2026-04-28):** the original implementation read `node.cache` synchronously at construction (graceful-degrade), which violated §5.8 / §5.10 — long-lived structures shouldn't capture cache values once. Replaced with **switchMap-pattern rebuild**: when the caller supplies a `Node<T>`, the pipeline subscribes via `switchMap(optsNode, opts => primitive(...))` and rebuilds the layer on every option emission. Each rebuild creates a fresh primitive instance — internal state is lost (rate-limiter pending buffer, breaker failure count, retry attempt count, in-flight timeout). Per-layer **companion Nodes** (`droppedCount`, `rateLimitState`, `breakerState`) are exposed ONLY for the static-options path; reactive-options leaves them `undefined` (each rebuild creates new companion instances; switchMap-mirroring would track only the latest bundle). Primitive-side widening (filed in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) "Tier 5.2 follow-up — primitive-side reactive-options widening") will preserve internal state once it lands and the pipeline will trivially forward Node-form options to the primitive — at which point reactive-options + companions become available together with no call-site change.
- **D7 — `rateLimitState` companion landed.** `extra/resilience/rateLimiter` now ships `RateLimiterBundle.rateLimitState: Node<RateLimiterState>` alongside the existing `droppedCount`. `RateLimiterState = {droppedCount, pendingCount, paused}` with structural-equality dedup at the emit boundary so steady-state pass-through doesn't generate one DATA per source DATA. Pipeline exposes it as `pipeline.rateLimitState` and mounts it under `rateLimitState` in `describe()`.
- **D8 — caller `meta` option on each resilience primitive landed.** `rateLimiter`, `withStatus`, `withBreaker`, `timeout`, `retry`, `fallback` each accept an `meta?: Record<string, unknown>` option that merges into the produced node's `meta` (caller keys first; primitive's companion seeds + `factoryTag` win the merge so the audit trail can't be silently overwritten). `budgetGate` already supported `meta` (Tier 3.3 carry-through). The pipeline stamps `domainMeta("resilient", "<kind>")` on each layer's intermediate node so `describe()` / mermaid grouping surfaces the canonical resilience-domain tag the audit Wave-B Unit 7 §A required.
- Per-layer companions exposed today: `breakerState` (when `breaker` configured), `droppedCount` + `rateLimitState` (when `rateLimit` configured). `budgetState` / `retryAttempts` / `lastTimeout` still deferred — each requires the underlying primitive to ship the corresponding Node first. Tickets filed alongside the reactive-options entry in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) "Tier 5.2 follow-up — primitive-side reactive-options widening".
- `breakerOnOpen` + `retry` interaction documented in module JSDoc: with `"error"` + `retry`, retry sees `CircuitOpenError` and resubscribes against an open circuit, burning its budget; default `"skip"` emits `RESOLVED` (downstream drops the beat without retry firing).
- `timeoutMs` upper bound (9_000_000 ms ≈ 2.5h) preserves safe ns arithmetic; same `RangeError` as before plus an explicit overflow guard.
- Self-tags via `g.tagFactory("resilientPipeline", placeholderArgs(opts))` so `describe().factory === "resilientPipeline"` and `describe().factoryArgs` substitutes Node-typed and function-typed fields with `"<Node>"` / `"<function>"` placeholders.
- `resilientFetch` migration audit: only `resilientFetchTemplate` (a graphspec template in [evals/lib/portable-templates.ts](evals/lib/portable-templates.ts)) carries the `resilientFetch` name. It's a `GraphSpec`, not a wrapper around `resilientPipeline`. No call sites to migrate; the JSDoc reference in `resilient-pipeline/index.ts` remains as a pointer to the portable counterpart.
- Tests (`__tests__/patterns/resilient-pipeline.test.ts` rewritten): 17 cases covering Graph-subclass shape / per-layer presence / describe surface / reactive options / Node-form `undefined` cache fallthrough / `tagFactory` provenance / primitive factory-tag preservation / `rateLimitState` shape / `domainMeta` per-layer assertions across all 7 layers (rate-limit / budget / breaker / timeout / retry / fallback / status). 17/17 green.
**Depends on:** Tier 3.1 (retry / breaker / timeout / fallback supervisors), Tier 3.2 (rateLimiter / tokenBucket throttles + `withStatus`), Tier 3.3 (`budgetGate`), Tier 1.5.3 (graphspec factory tagging).

### 5.3 Unit 8 — graphLens reshape ✅ landed (2026-04-27, smaller scope per Session A.4 lock)
- **`LensGraph` class deleted** along with `TopologyStats` / `computeTopologyStats` / `topologyStatsEqual` / `pathFilter` / `maxFlowPaths` / `why` / `flowEntryNode` / `whyCacheSize` (the audit's J+K lock surface — superseded by this reshape). Callers needing causal chains use `target.explain(from, to, { reactive: true })` directly; topology stats are a one-line `derived([topology], computeStats)` over the new preset's `topology` Node.
- **Shipped `graphLens(target)`** in [patterns/lens/index.ts](src/patterns/lens/index.ts) (~80 LOC including JSDoc, ~50 LOC of code). Wires the preset over the already-shipped `describe({reactive:true})` + `observe({reactive:true, tiers:["data"]})`:
  - `topology: Node<GraphDescribeOutput>` — `target.describe({reactive: true, detail: "standard"})`. Re-emits on structural change AND status transitions (`_describeReactive` already listens to data/error/complete/teardown observe events; we don't need a separate `failures` dep).
  - `health: Node<HealthReport>` — `derived([topology], computeHealthReport, {equals: healthReportEqual, meta: domainMeta("lens", "health")})`. Equality-deduped.
  - `flow: Node<ReadonlyMap<string, FlowEntry>>` — `derived([dataFlow, topology], …, {meta: domainMeta("lens", "flow")})`. Closure-mirror map (COMPOSITION-GUIDE §28). Each emit applies new changeset events FIRST then reconciles against topology so removed nodes drop entries cleanly. `lastAppliedChangeset` reference guards against double-applying when topology re-emits without a new changeset.
  - `dispose()` — tears down `topologyHandle.dispose()` + `keepalive(health)` + `keepalive(flow)`. Idempotent.
- `HealthProblem` / `HealthReport` / `FlowEntry` / `GraphLensView` types exported. `computeHealthReport` + `healthReportEqual` exported as pure helpers for composition. `watchTopologyTree` re-export retained.
- Tests (`__tests__/patterns/lens.test.ts` rewritten): 11 cases covering topology live re-emit / structural change / transitive subgraph coverage / health ok / health error transition / upstreamCause / flow per-path counter / qualified-path keys / removal reconciliation / fresh-snapshot-per-emit / domain-meta tagging via `describeNode` / lifecycle dispose. 11/11 green.
- README "6 vision blocks" line: `graphLens()` row now describes "topology / health / flow data + use `graph.explain({ reactive: true })` for causal chains" — pending follow-up edit (out-of-scope for this pass).
**Depends on:** Tier 1.5.1 (describe-reactive), Tier 1.5.2 (observe-reactive + tiers), Tier 3.5 (D.2.2 `reactiveExplainPath` deletion).

## Tier 6 — Harness composition ✅ landed (2026-04-28, Wave 2C)

All seven sub-units landed across earlier feature waves and the Tier 6.5 C2 batch. Status reconciliation captured below; code citations point to the current `loop.ts`.

### 6.1 Unit 16 — Stratify → Hub + TopicBridgeGraph (Session B.1 + B.2 lock) ✅ landed
`HarnessGraph.queues` IS `MessagingHubGraph` directly ([loop.ts:251](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:251)). Routing is data (topic name) — `triageOutput` published by router effect, `topicBridge`s fan out by `map: (item) => item.route === route ? item : undefined` per-route + `__unrouted` dead-letter ([loop.ts:466–479](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:466)). Foreign-node-accept canonical: gate consumes `topic.latest` directly, no `gateGraph.mount` of foreign topics ([loop.ts:539–553](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:539)).

### 6.2 Unit 17 — GATE stage reshape + `gate()` primitive shape (Session B.1 lock) ✅ landed
Per-route `gateGraph.approvalGate(route, topic.latest, opts)` between hub topic and the merge-into-executeFlow bridge ([loop.ts:539–553](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:539)). Foreign-node-accept eliminated the `gateGraph.add(...)` ceremony.

### 6.3 Unit 20 — Named nodes (Session B.3 lock) ✅ landed (2026-04-28)
Tier 6.5 C2 reshape registered all pre-1.0 anonymous intermediates with descriptive names: `triage-input`, `triage`, `router-input`, `execute-input`, `execute-enqueue`, `verify-dispatch`, `reflect`, `strategy` ([loop.ts:792–800](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:792)). The `executeFlow` JobFlow exposes per-stage queues + pumps via standard mount paths (`executeFlow::execute::*`, `executeFlow::verify::*`).
- **✅ Regression test landed:** [harness.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/harness.test.ts) "explain(intake.latest, reflect) returns a chain with no `<anonymous>` steps" — walks the causal chain end-to-end and asserts no step path contains `<anonymous>`.

### 6.4 Unit 18b — `fastRetry` extraction + 3 correctness fixes ✅ landed
The pre-Tier-6.5 fastRetry effect carried all three Unit 18b fixes (Unit 18b C: source/severity preserved on reingestion; D: null-execRaw guard; E: errorClassifier consumes the executor's real outcome). The Tier 6.5 C2 reshape replaced the fastRetry effect with a **post-completed dispatch effect** at [loop.ts:684–747](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:684). All three correctness invariants survive: source/severity preserved at the structural-failure reingest path, null-payload guards (`if (execution == null || verify == null) ackJob(item); continue;`), and the error classifier consumes `execution.outcome` for the self-correctable / structural decision. Helper extraction (`assembleResult` / `handleVerified` / `handleRetry` / `handleStructural`) carried forward into the dispatch-effect body.

### 6.5 JobFlow claim/ack/nack for EXECUTE ✅ landed (2026-04-28, C2 lock — Tier 6.5)
**EXECUTE → VERIFY now runs through an internal `executeFlow` JobFlow** with two stages (`execute`, `verify`) ([loop.ts:582–602](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:582)). The Q1–Q6 design lock (2026-04-28) shaped the implementation:
- **Q1 — C2 partial JobFlow:** pre-flow (intake / triage / queues / gates / retry topic) unchanged; only EXECUTE → VERIFY moved into JobFlow.
- **Q2 — Verify outcome encoding (b1):** verify work fn always emits a `HarnessJobPayload<A>` with `verify: VerifyOutput` populated; JobFlow's binary pump auto-advances to `flow.completed`; the post-completed dispatch effect routes the 3-way verdict.
- **Q3 — Reingest:** stays imperative `intake.publish(...)` from inside the dispatch effect (§32 / §35 sanctioned terminal side-effect with audit trail).
- **Q4 — Gates:** stay pre-JobFlow (per-route `gateGraph.approvalGate(...)`).
- **Q5 — Parallelism:** `executeMaxPerPump` / `verifyMaxPerPump` opt-in caps in `HarnessLoopOptions`; default `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (matches today's unbounded `merge()` parallelism). **D1 follow-up landed (2026-04-28):** `JobFlow.StageDef.maxPerPump` per-stage override added; harness now passes `executeMaxPerPump` and `verifyMaxPerPump` as independent per-stage caps (no more `Math.min` collapse). `optimizations.md` "Per-stage `maxPerPump` on JobFlow" entry resolved.
- **Q6 — Executor / verifier interface:** breaking change pre-1.0. Old `(input: Node<TriagedItem | null>) => Node<ExecuteOutput<A> | null>` shape replaced with work-fn shape `(job: JobEnvelope<HarnessJobPayload<A>>) => NodeInput<HarnessJobPayload<A>>` ([types.ts:HarnessExecutor / HarnessVerifier](src/patterns/harness/types.ts)). `defaultLlmExecutor` / `defaultLlmVerifier` migrated to direct `adapter.invoke()` calls via the shared `_oneShotLlmCall` helper ([patterns/ai/_internal.ts](src/patterns/ai/_internal.ts), D2 extraction) — the helper owns subscription / abort / first-DATA capture / COMPLETE-without-DATA arm; call sites own JSON parse + payload mapping. `refineExecutor` / `actuatorExecutor` / `evalVerifier` migrated to per-claim work-fn shape (no internal switchMap — pump owns per-claim lifecycle).
  - **Bridge-layer error classification (Q2 extension via qa F3, 2026-04-28):** parse / adapter throw / ERROR / COMPLETE-without-DATA paths classify as `errorClass: "self-correctable"` so the dispatch effect routes via the retry budget; only the defensive "no prior execution" guard stays `structural`. Symmetric on executor side via the `defaultErrorClassifier` regex matching `parse|json|config|validation|syntax` keywords in the failure detail.
  - **Q6 scope clarification (D2):** "no `promptNode` internally" applies to EXECUTE/VERIFY default work fns. TRIAGE retains `promptNode` because it legitimately needs cross-wave switchMap supersede (one node watches all intake items); per-claim work-fn shape doesn't fit. Documented in `archive/optimizations/resolved-decisions.jsonl`.

**Per-route `jobQueue` audit mirrors retained** as a parallel ledger ([loop.ts:497–530](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:497)). Two complementary observability axes:
- **Per-route depth/pending** (this ledger) — "how backed up is auto-fix?"
- **Per-stage depth/pending** (executeFlow's stage queues) — "how many items are mid-execute?"

**`harnessTrace` / `harnessProfile` updated** via `HarnessGraph.stageNodes()` ([loop.ts:339–360](src/patterns/harness/loop.ts:339)): EXECUTE label points at `executeFlow::execute::events`, VERIFY at `executeFlow::verify::events`. Inspection-tools decoupling held — no edits to `trace.ts` or `profile.ts` were needed.

**D3 — Stage trace path semantics changed pre-1.0.** Pre-Tier-6.5 the EXECUTE / VERIFY observable paths emitted `ExecuteOutput<A>` / `VerifyOutput` payloads (the `executeNode` / `verifyNode` Nodes). Post-Tier-6.5 they emit `JobEvent` audit-stream records (`{action: "enqueue"|"claim"|"ack"|"nack"|"remove", id, attempts, t_ns, seq, payload?}`). Anyone calling `harness.observe("execute")` directly (rather than via the labeled stage paths) gets path-not-found; anyone observing the labeled stages gets a different message shape. For verdict payloads, observe `harness.executeFlow.completed` (`Node<readonly JobEnvelope<HarnessJobPayload<A>>[]>`) instead. Pre-1.0 break documented; no migration shim shipped.

**FIFO-mismatch hazard resolved by design.** The pre-Tier-6.5 inline comment defending `removeById` against decoupled `claim`/`ack` across reactive waves is now obsolete: JobFlow's pump owns the entire `claim → work → ack` lifecycle in one closure ([job-queue/index.ts](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts) pump body), so the cross-wave decoupling that motivated the hazard never arises. The audit-side jq ledger keeps `enqueue + removeById` semantics by design (purely an audit log of route entries; ack-by-id via `trackingKey` lookup).

**Tests:** all 2470 tests passing (1 new explain regression for Tier 6.3, full executor-variant test migration to work-fn shape covering happy path / failure modes / one-DATA-per-claim contract / dispatchActuator route resolution / actuator+evalVerifier end-to-end / refine+evalVerifier convergence). Build green; lint at the 9-warning baseline.

**Out-of-scope deviations from the C2 lock:**
- `promptNode` no longer used internally by the harness (the work-fn shape doesn't benefit from cross-wave switchMap). `promptNode` stays the canonical primitive for **persistent reactive LLM transforms** (agentLoop, user code, the harness's TRIAGE stage which still uses it).
- `executeContextNode` pairing eliminated — payloads carry `item` through stages, removing the cross-wave `withLatestFrom` pairing that was load-bearing pre-C2.

### 6.6 Unit 1 — `promptNode` JSDoc + test gate (Session C lock, reduced scope) ✅ landed
- **✅ JSDoc cross-link to COMPOSITION-GUIDE §32 landed:** [prompt-node.ts:31–38](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-node.ts:31) — cross-wave cache stickiness pattern.
- **✅ Middleware recipe landed:** [prompt-node.ts:16–29](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-node.ts:16) and [:129–131](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-node.ts:129) — `withRetry` / `withReplayCache` adapter stack.
- **✅ Isolated unit test (Session C L8) landed (2026-04-27):** [phase5-llm-composition.test.ts](src/__tests__/phase5-llm-composition.test.ts) — "N upstream dep waves → exactly N DATAs on `prompt_node::output`, zero transient nulls, zero coalesce loss" covering 3 waves with synchronous `mockAdapter`. Locks the contract independent of harness entanglement.
- **✅ Open Q (Session C L9) resolved (2026-04-27, renamed 2026-04-30):** `prompt_node::response` is **transient by design** — it activates inside switchMap during a wave and tears down on supersede / COMPLETE. With a synchronous adapter the producer activates and completes within the same wave, so steady-state `describe()` only shows `::messages` + `::output`. Mid-wave `describe()` (real async adapter, observed during in-flight call) WOULD see `::response` via `meta.ai = "prompt_node::response"`. Regression test landed in `phase5-llm-composition.test.ts`.

### 6.7 Unit 2 — `gatedStream` timing (3 skipped tests) ✅ landed
The 4 previously-skipped tests un-skipped at [ai.test.ts:894–1034](src/__tests__/patterns/ai.test.ts:894). Inline comment confirms the keepalive fix on the gate's output node, which closed the activation gap that left streamed values reaching the gate's input but never entering the pending queue.

---

## Tier 7 — AI module ergonomics ✅ landed (reconciled 2026-04-28; units shipped earlier across Waves A/2A/AM, plan markup caught up here)

### 7.1 Unit 14 — `firstDataFromNode` migration + Unit 6 `executeReactive` ✅ landed (Wave A Unit 4 trio, 2026-04-24)
`executeReactive(name, args) → Node<unknown>` shipped at [tool-registry.ts:98](src/patterns/ai/agents/tool-registry.ts:98); `toolExecution` consumes it at [tool-execution.ts:151](src/patterns/ai/agents/tool-execution.ts:151); imperative `execute()` was removed in the QA pass (2026-04-24). `firstDataFromNode` retained as sanctioned boundary bridge in [_internal.ts:53](src/patterns/ai/_internal.ts:53).

### 7.2 C24-7 — Reactive spec/strategy variants ✅ landed
`graphFromSpecReactive(input, adapter) → Node<Graph>` shipped at [graph-from-spec.ts:144](src/patterns/ai/graph-integration/graph-from-spec.ts:144); `suggestStrategyReactive(graph, problem, adapter) → Node<StrategyPlan>` at [suggest-strategy.ts:167](src/patterns/ai/graph-integration/suggest-strategy.ts:167).

### 7.3 Unit 12 — Google SDK swap ✅ landed (DONE 2026-04-24, AI/harness review tail)
`@google/generative-ai` → `@google/genai` in [src/patterns/ai/adapters/providers/google.ts](src/patterns/ai/adapters/providers/google.ts) — `GoogleSdkLike` tightened to single-param `generateContent({ model, contents, config })` shape, `abortSignal` under `config`. `package.json` already on `@google/genai ^1.48.0`.

### 7.4 C24-1 — `compileSpec` `opts.onMissing` mode ✅ landed
`onMissing?: "error" | "warn" | "placeholder"` (default `"placeholder"`) shipped at [graphspec/index.ts:709](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts:709) with `MissingCatalogEntry` aggregation across compile passes.

### 7.5 DF12 — `promptNode.tools` reactive widening ✅ landed (2026-04-28, Tier 7+8 batch)
`tools?: Node<readonly ToolDefinition[]>` — pure reactive declared edge (no static-array path; internal-only API, no callers needed preservation). Tools Node is appended to `messagesNode`'s declared deps in [prompt-node.ts](src/patterns/ai/prompts/prompt-node.ts), so tools changes re-invoke the LLM and the tools edge appears in `describe()` / `explain()`. `messagesNode` emits an envelope `{ messages, tools }` consumed by the per-wave switchMap inner. Activation note in JSDoc: caller passes `state<ToolDefinition[]>([])` for immediate activation with no tools. Regression test in `ai.test.ts` `patterns.ai.promptNode > "reactive tools: tools Node feeds the adapter and re-invokes on tools change"`.

---

## Tier 8 — Wave C cross-pattern mutation framework migration ✅ landed (2026-04-28, with two deferrals)

**γ-0 (framework change):** `MutationOpts.audit?` made optional. `lightMutation` / `wrapMutation` now provide freeze + rollback + seq-advance + re-throw semantics independent of audit-record emission. Cluster II sites adopt the framework without introducing new audit log Node surfaces. `MutationOpts<TArgs, R>` widened to `MutationOpts<TArgs, TResult, R>` so `onSuccess` builders see the typed result rather than `unknown`. See [extra/mutation/index.ts:149](src/extra/mutation/index.ts:149).

| # | Site | Tool | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `messaging/Topic.publish` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (no audit; route through framework for centralized re-throw — `events` log already records publishes) |
| 2 | `messaging/Subscription.ack` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (no audit; cursor's emission stream already records advances) |
| 3 | `messaging/Subscription.pullAndAck` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (corrected from plan's `Subscription.take`; `pull` skipped — read-only) |
| 4 | `messaging/Hub.delete` (i.e. `removeTopic`) | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (no audit; γ-4 closure-state JSDoc caveat added) |
| 5 | `cqrs/dispatch` | `wrapMutation` | ✅ landed (highest-value: replaces ~110 LOC inline impl with framework call; M5 / C4 invariants preserved; `cmdNode.meta.error` only stamped when user handler throws via `actionThrew` flag) |
| 6 | `cqrs/saga` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (per-event handler invocation hoisted as `auditedHandler` wrapper; outer try/catch retained for `errorPolicy` advance/hold semantics; downgraded from `wrapMutation` because per-event batch frames would change saga's wave timing) |
| 7 | `process/start` | `wrapMutation` | **DEFERRED** — wrapping would change failure semantics: today swallows synthetic-event-emit errors and still records "running"; `wrapMutation` rollback would convert that into "failed dispatch". Surface for design call before migrating. |
| 8 | `process/cancel` | `wrapMutation` | **DEFERRED** — fire-and-forget async compensate; `wrapMutation` is sync-only. Wrapping the synchronous prelude alone adds noise without value. Same design call as #7. |
| 9 | `job-queue/enqueue` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (private `_enqueueImpl` instance field; lightMutation bumps seq before action runs, action body reads `_seqCursor.cache` for auto-id generation) |
| 10 | `job-queue/ack` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (private `_ackImpl`) |
| 11 | `job-queue/nack` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (private `_nackImpl`) |
| 12 | `job-queue/removeById` | `lightMutation` | ✅ landed (private `_removeByIdImpl`) |

**`job-queue/claim` retained inline** — multi-record loop emits one record per claimed job; `lightMutation`'s single-call → single-record contract doesn't fit. `claim` now uses the framework's `bumpCursor(this._seqCursor)` helper directly per iteration.

**Plan deviations from γ-1..6 confirmation:**
- γ-1 collapsed by γ-0: no `attachAudit()` lazy-attach method shipped; messaging sites simply route through framework with `audit` omitted. Future audit consumers can later add a `MessagingHubMutation` / `TopicMutation` / `SubscriptionAckMutation` record schema and pass `audit` through if a real consumer surfaces.
- γ-2 cqrs cursor: `_dispatchSeqCursor` was already promoted via `registerCursor` pre-Tier-8 (Wave 2C). γ-2 closure-counter promotion confirmed already in place across cqrs/job-queue.
- γ-5 / γ-6 deferred to Tier 10 follow-up (audit-record schemas + `keyOf` exports for messaging primitives — only meaningful when a real audit consumer surfaces).

**Tests added:** 3 regression tests (`extra/mutation/mutation.test.ts` × 2 — `lightMutation` and `wrapMutation` audit-omitted opt-in; `patterns/ai.test.ts` × 1 — DF12 reactive tools re-invoke).

**Verification:** 2491 tests passing (+3 new), build green (ESM + CJS + DTS), lint clean at 9-warning baseline.

**Depends on:** Tier 2.2 (mutation framework promoted), Tier 4 + 5 (proof-of-concept established).

---

## Tier 9 — Consolidation finishing (Phases 4–5)

### 9.1 Phase 4 — presets split ✅ landed (2026-04-28, γ-form γ-β / γ-ii / γ-II / γ-R-2)

Folder reorg locks: γ-β (sub-folder per preset), γ-ii (`inspect/` sub-files mirror old folders), γ-II (`inspect()` is a `Graph` subclass), γ-R-2 (`resilientPipeline` lives in `extra/resilience/`, not `ai/`), Q5-5 (i) (`agentMemory` / `agentLoop` physically moved), Q5-6 medium (`inspect()` composes lens + auditTrail + explainTarget facade + `complianceSnapshot()` method; `policyGate` stays separate).

**Physical moves landed:**
- `patterns/resilient-pipeline/` → [extra/resilience/resilient-pipeline.ts](src/extra/resilience/resilient-pipeline.ts) (γ-R-2). Re-exported through `extra/resilience/index.ts`. Old folder moved to `TRASH/`.
- `patterns/refine-loop/` → [patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts](src/patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts) (γ-β). Re-exported through `patterns/harness/index.ts`. Old folder moved to `TRASH/`.
- `patterns/harness/loop.ts` → [patterns/harness/presets/harness-loop.ts](src/patterns/harness/presets/harness-loop.ts) (γ-β).
- `patterns/ai/memory/agent-memory.ts` → [patterns/ai/presets/agent-memory.ts](src/patterns/ai/presets/agent-memory.ts) (Q5-5 (i)).
- `patterns/ai/agents/agent-loop.ts` → [patterns/ai/presets/agent-loop.ts](src/patterns/ai/presets/agent-loop.ts) (Q5-5 (i)).
- `patterns/audit/index.ts` + `patterns/lens/index.ts` + `patterns/guarded-execution/index.ts` merged into [patterns/inspect/](src/patterns/inspect/) as sub-files (γ-ii). Old folders moved to `TRASH/`.

**New `inspect()` preset** (Q5-6 medium scope) at [patterns/inspect/presets/inspect.ts](src/patterns/inspect/presets/inspect.ts) — `class InspectGraph extends Graph` mounts `graphLens(target)` + `auditTrail(target)` and exposes `explainTarget(...)` (delegates to `target.explain`) + `complianceSnapshot()` method. Mounts `lensTopology` / `health` / `flow` (lens nodes) and `audit::*` (auditTrail subgraph) under stable describable paths. `policyGate` intentionally NOT bundled — control-plane primitive, conceptually distinct from inspection.

**Pre-1.0 break inventory** (no shims):
- `patterns/index.ts`: dropped `accountability` / `lens` / `guarded` / `resilientPipeline` / `refine` namespaces. New `inspect` namespace replaces audit + lens + guarded-execution. `resilientPipeline` ships through `@graphrefly/graphrefly/extra`. `refineLoop` / `harnessLoop` ship through `harness.refineLoop` / `harness.harnessLoop`.
- `package.json` exports: dropped `./patterns/audit`, `./patterns/lens`, `./patterns/guarded-execution`, `./patterns/refine-loop`, `./patterns/resilient-pipeline`. Added `./patterns/inspect`.
- `tsup.config.ts` ENTRY_POINTS updated.
- Symbol rename: `bridge.ts` `EvalResult` → `EvalRunResult` (collision with `refine-loop.ts` `EvalResult`; bridge's shape was `{run_id, model, tasks}` — distinct from refineLoop's `{taskId, score, candidateIndex}` per-task scoring shape; bridge had narrower blast radius).

**Tests added:** `src/__tests__/patterns/inspect-preset.test.ts` — 6 cases covering subclass shape, mounted lens node names, target-ref + lens + audit access, `explainTarget(static)`, `complianceSnapshot()`, audit subgraph mount.

**Test import migrations:** ~10+ test files updated (audit / lens / guarded-execution → inspect/*; refine-loop → harness/presets/refine-loop; resilient-pipeline → extra/resilience; agent-memory + agent-loop → ai/presets/*; harness loop.ts → harness/presets/harness-loop).

### 9.2 Phase 5 — `classifyError` (only when caller surfaces) — DEFERRED
`classifyError(source, classifierFn) → { routes: Record<string, Node<T>> }` in `extra/resilience/`. Defer until a real consumer needs it.

### 9.3 Topology check as shipped utility ✅ landed (2026-04-28)
[`validateNoIslands(graph)`](src/graph/validate-no-islands.ts) companion to `validateGraphObservability`. Returns `{ orphans: readonly string[]; ok: boolean; summary() }`. Reports nodes with zero in-edges AND zero out-edges (true islands); sources (≥1 out, 0 in) and sinks (≥1 in, 0 out) are not flagged. Re-exported from `src/graph/index.ts`. 5 regression tests in [src/__tests__/graph/validate-no-islands.test.ts](src/__tests__/graph/validate-no-islands.test.ts).

---

## Tier 10 — Polish, follow-ups, low-priority

### 10.1 `mapFromSnapshot` / `extractStoreMap` cleanup ✅ landed (2026-04-28)
The sibling helper `extractStoreMap` was deleted in Wave AM Unit 5 (Tier 4.7). The `mapFromSnapshot` helper at `composite.ts` was deleted in this batch (Tier 9.1) — replaced with the inline `((snapshot as ReadonlyMap<string, TMem> | undefined) ?? new Map<string, TMem>())` pattern at the 5 former call sites (mirrors Wave AM Unit 5's idiom).

### 10.2 `diffMap<K, V>` operator extraction
Wait for third consumer; YAGNI today.

### 10.3 Harness executor/verifier dev-mode sanity check
Assert ≤1 DATA per input wave in dev mode.

### 10.4 JSDoc additions ✅ landed (2026-04-28, Tier 9.1 batch ride-along)
- C23-2: `Evaluator<T>` JSDoc on `candidateIndex` semantics — already present at [patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts:114–122](src/patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts:114).
- C24-3: `validateSpec` effect-node feedback warning — added at [patterns/graphspec/index.ts](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts) (advisory text on the `validateSpec` JSDoc explaining `warnings` covers feedback-from-effect-node).
- C24-4: `runReduction` sync-settle deferred-unsubscribe ordering invariant — formalized at [patterns/surface/reduce.ts](src/patterns/surface/reduce.ts) `Sync-settle deferred-unsubscribe invariant (C24-4)` block.
- (C24-2 ✅ obsolete — `decompileGraph` removed entirely in Tier 1.5.3 Phase 3; `decompileSpec` is `g.describe({ detail: "spec" })` plus a feedback-edge sugar scan, no fingerprinting.)

### 10.5 Operator-layer `filter` mixed-batch RESOLVED forwarding
Filter drops RESOLVED for failed batch entries → tier-3 counter drift. Low priority; no current consumer affected.
**Blocked by:** operator-layer-wide review session (deferred).

### 10.6 `restoreSnapshot` rejects `mode: "diff"` records
**Blocked by:** §8.7 WAL replay (prerequisite for diff replay).

### 10.7 Performance follow-ups
- Message-array allocation in hot path (A2 landed; tier-3 DATA/ERROR has further headroom).
- Fan-out scaling — sink notification overhead (profiling harness at `src/__bench__/fanout-profile.ts`); ongoing measurement.

### 10.8 Design follow-ups (deferred — file in optimizations.md when re-opened)
- `graphLens` 50k-node scaling (incremental delta stats vs full describe-per-tick). `graphLens(target)` still ships as a standalone factory; the `inspect()` preset embeds an instance as `inspect.lens.*` (Tier 9.1) — the scaling concern applies in both consumption modes.
- `graphLens.health` V2 (`completed` / `disconnected` flag classes; aggregate metrics).
- `lens.flow` delta companion.
- TopicGraph reactive `retainedLimit` (unblocks reactive `violationsLimit` on `policyGate` — `policyGate` now lives at [patterns/inspect/audit.ts](src/patterns/inspect/audit.ts) post Tier 9.1 γ-ii merge).
- `Graph.explain({reactive: true})` file-path-scoped observe (composes with Tier 1.5.2 `tiers` filter — natural follow-on for `pathScope` opt). The legacy `reactiveExplainPath` was deleted in Tier 3.5; the equivalent capability lives on `Graph.explain(...)` with `reactive: true` per Tier 1.5 / 3.5.
- End-of-batch `_handleBudgetMessage` boolean-return / forward-unknown audit across producer-pattern factories.
- `withStatus` decomposition (alternative (e)). Lives at [extra/resilience/index.ts](src/extra/resilience/index.ts) post Tier 2.1 reorg.
- `refineLoop` persistent re-seed / reset surface (awaits real-world demand). Lives at [patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts](src/patterns/harness/presets/refine-loop.ts) post Tier 9.1 γ-β.

### 10.9 InspectGraph + processManager carry-throughs from Tier 9.1 /qa (added 2026-04-28)
Defer-until-consumer items surfaced by /qa B-group fixes; tracked here so they don't get lost when revisiting Tier 9 / Tier 10:
- **Framework gap:** `Graph._destroyClearOnly` doesn't drain child mounts' `_disposers`. Affects every mounted child graph (auditTrail, LensSubgraph, etc.). Fix: drain `child._disposers` inside `_destroyClearOnly` before clearing structure. Defer until a real disposer leak is observed in production.
- **`processManager.dispose()` doesn't unmount mounted nodes** (`${name}_process_seq`, `${name}_process_instances`). Fixture-style create+dispose loops accumulate nodes on the cqrsGraph indefinitely. Long-term fix: either `Graph.removeNode(name)` (broad feature) OR mount under a child `mount("__processManagers__/${name}", subgraph)` for clean teardown.
- **`auditTrail.includeTypes` introspectability** — currently private. Expose as readonly field or via meta so consumers can validate `complianceSnapshot.fingerprint` against the exact recorded set.
- **`validateNoIslands` reactive companion** — for continuous-validation use cases on large graphs (10k+ nodes), each call rebuilds the full `describe({detail:"minimal"})` snapshot. Future: `validateNoIslandsReactive(graph): Node<ValidateNoIslandsResult>` subscribed to topology changes.
- **`bumpCursor` silent reset diagnostic** — surface a one-shot `console.warn` (or meta-counter) when a cursor restores from a non-numeric snapshot, so seq-monotonicity violations don't cascade silently.

Tier 9 consolidation finishing — after Tiers 4/5/6 prove patterns
Tier 10 — anytime; low priority
```

**Critical path:** Tier 1.5 (graph-module API additions) → Tier 2 (mechanical reorg) → Tier 3 (parallel audits) → Tier 4+5 (parallel) → Tier 6 → Tier 8 → Tier 9.

**Recommended kickoff order:**
1. ✅ Land Tier 1.1 spec amendment + Tier 1.6.1 COMPOSITION-GUIDE §38 (doc-only edits in `~/src/graphrefly`).
2. ✅ Run Session C (Tier 1.2) — short, can happen alongside other work.
3. ✅ Implement Tier 1.5.1 + 1.5.2 (describe-diff, observe-reactive, tiers filter) — they unblock Tier 5.3 graphLens preset.
4. ✅ Implement Tier 1.5.3 (GraphSpec ≡ GraphDescribeOutput) — Phases 1, 2, 2.5, 3 all landed.
5. ✅ Land Tier 2.1 reorg (mechanical split + renderer extraction). **Carry:** per-category sub-file split inside `operators/` / `sources/` / `io/` / `resilience/` — physical mega-file move done; canonical body still lives in each `<folder>/index.ts`. Schedule the per-protocol split in a follow-up batch.
6. ✅ Land Tier 2.2 + Tier 2.3 (Wave 2A — promotions + renames + outcome/status enum migrations).
7. ✅ Land Tier 3 audits (Wave 2B — 5 units via 3 parallel agents; required port pass since worktrees branched from main).
8. ✅ Tier 5.1 (`guardedExecution`) + Tier 5.3 (`graphLens` reshape) landed (2026-04-27, parallel batch).
9. ✅ Tier 5.2 (`resilientPipeline` Graph-subclass rewrite + reactive options + companions + `tagFactory` provenance) and Tier 4 Wave AM follow-ups (Unit 1 `DEFAULT_DECAY_RATE` extraction, Unit 4 `llm-memory.ts` → `prompt-call.ts` promotion, Unit 5 `extractStoreMap` deletion) landed (2026-04-27). Wave A + Wave AM closed; Wave B closed.
10. ✅ /qa pass on Tier 5.2 + Wave AM batch (2026-04-28) — all approved fixes patched in-batch:
    - **G1A "same concept"** — `wrapper.scopedDescribe: Node<GraphDescribeOutput>` mounted property is the canonical reactive describe (one per wrapper, no per-call leak). `scopedDescribeNode(actorOverride, opts)` retained as the per-call escape hatch returning `{node, dispose}`.
    - **G1B** — caller-supplied `Node<Actor>` bridged through a derived w/ `null` initial to avoid SENTINEL stall on `scope`.
    - **G2A** — `graphLens.flow` uses monotonic `flushedAt_ns` cursor instead of changeset ref-comparison.
    - **G1C-prime** — `readOnce(opt.cache)` imperative-read removed from `resilient-pipeline`. Node-form pipeline options (rateLimit / budget / breaker / timeoutMs / retry) now use **switchMap-pattern rebuild**: subscribe to option Node, rebuild the layer on each emission. Per-layer companions exposed only for the static-options path. State-loss caveat documented; primitive-side widening remains the long-term fix.
    - **G2B (doc-only)** — F3/F6/F8 inline comments tightened; EC7 `rateLimitState` JSDoc clarified ("resets on producer-fn re-run"); EC5/EC6/EC7/F9 deferred items filed in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) under "QA follow-ups from Tier 5.2 + Wave-AM /qa pass".
11. ✅ Tier 6 harness composition landed (2026-04-28, Wave 2C). Tier 6.5 C2 lock (`executeFlow` JobFlow chain replacing `merge → executor → verifier → fastRetry`) implemented; Tier 6.3 named-node registrations + explain regression test in place; Tier 6.1 / 6.2 / 6.4 / 6.6 / 6.7 reconciled as already-landed across earlier feature waves. Breaking executor/verifier interface change pre-1.0: `(input: Node<T>) => Node<U>` → `(job: JobEnvelope<HarnessJobPayload<A>>) => NodeInput<HarnessJobPayload<A>>`. `defaultLlmExecutor` / `defaultLlmVerifier` migrated to direct `adapter.invoke()` (no internal `promptNode`). All 2470 tests passing; build green; lint at 9-warning baseline.
12. ✅ Tier 7 (AI ergonomics) markup reconciliation + DF12 (`promptNode.tools` reactive widening) and Tier 8 (Wave C cross-pattern mutation framework migration) landed (2026-04-28, single batch). Framework change γ-0 (`MutationOpts.audit?` optional) collapsed γ-1's audit-Node design tension; messaging sites adopt the framework without new audit surfaces. Two `process/*` migrations deferred (#7, #8) due to failure-semantics conflict — surface to a design call before migrating. 2491 tests passing; build green; lint at 9-warning baseline.
13. ✅ Tier 9.1 γ-form full (presets split + audit/lens/guarded-execution → inspect merge + new `inspect()` factory) + Tier 9.3 (`validateNoIslands`) + Tier 10.1 (`mapFromSnapshot` deletion-then-restore) + Tier 10.4 (JSDoc additions) + Tier 4 markup reconciliation + γ-7-B (process appendRecord lightMutation-wrap) landed (2026-04-28, single batch). Pre-1.0 break: dropped `./patterns/{audit,lens,guarded-execution,refine-loop,resilient-pipeline}` subpaths; added `./patterns/inspect`; renamed bridge.ts `EvalResult` → `EvalRunResult` (collision with refine-loop's `EvalResult`). 2502 tests passing (+6 inspect-preset, +5 validateNoIslands); build green; lint at 9-warning baseline.
14. ✅ /qa pass on Tier 9.1 batch (2026-04-28) — all approved patches applied in-batch:
    - **D1** — lens lives in a child `LensSubgraph` mounted at `lens::*`. `inspect.destroy()`'s TEARDOWN signal cascade reaches the lens via `_destroyClearOnly` (no broadcast) instead of via `_signalDeliver` over `inspect._nodes`. External `view.lens.topology.subscribe(...)` references are no longer invalidated by the parent's TEARDOWN broadcast.
    - **D2** — `mapFromSnapshot` helper restored at [extra/composite.ts](src/extra/composite.ts) and a parallel defensive `instanceof Map` check added at [ai/adapters/core/capabilities.ts](src/patterns/ai/adapters/core/capabilities.ts). Tier 10.1's deletion was over-eager; the helper is the safety net for snapshot-restore paths where `JsonGraphCodec` round-trips a `Map` as a plain `{}`.
    - **D3** — `processManager` detects existing `${name}_process_instances` / `${name}_process_seq` mounts via `cqrsGraph.tryResolve(...)` and throws a specific error message before attempting `Graph.add`.
    - **D4** — `appendRecord` `freeze: true` (process states are typically small workflow records; prevents post-record state mutation from corrupting audit history).
    - **D5** — saga audit-record `aggregateId` always includes the key (parity with pre-Tier-8 shape; preserves `Object.hasOwn` semantics).
    - **D6** — accepted dispatch error-emit ↔ audit-append order flip (no code change; both events still fire same-wave).
    - **D7** — `validateNoIslands` JSDoc strengthened to call out the false-positive case (state nodes consumed only by external subscribers).
    - **A1** — `inspect()` self-tags via `tagFactory("inspect", placeholderArgs(opts))`.
    - **A2/A3** — `validateNoIslands` returns `IslandReport[]` with `{path, kind}` (kind helps triage state-orphans vs derived-orphans).
    - **A4** — added 4 new inspect-preset tests (reactive `explainTarget`, `inspect.topology` ≠ `inspect.lens.topology`, lens-mount path qualification, lens observes target not inspect) + 1 subgraph test for `validateNoIslands`.
    - **A5** — `appendRecord` / `appendRecordWithReason` collapsed into one helper.
    - **A6** — `InspectGraph.complianceSnapshot.policies` typed directly as `PolicyGateGraph`.
    - **A7** — fingerprint truncation caveat echoed in `inspect.complianceSnapshot()` JSDoc.
    - **A8** — `auditTrail` seq overflow comment fixed ("stagnates" not "wraps").
    - **A9** — `validateNoIslands` sort test now uses ASCII-distinct insertion order.
    - **A10** — `InspectGraph` JSDoc tightened to clarify path-namespace boundary (inspect.node("counter") does NOT resolve into target).
    - Remaining deferred items filed in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) "QA follow-ups from Tier 9.1 /qa pass".
    - 2508 tests passing (+9 over Tier 9.1 land); lint clean (9-warning baseline); build green.
15. ✅ Polish + regression-test backfill batch landed (2026-04-28). 4-sub-batch ride-along sweep with no structural changes:
    - **Batch A — adapter abort regression tests.** Audit confirmed every shipped provider (anthropic / openai-compat / google fetch + SDK paths, chrome-nano browser shim, webllm browser SDK) already plumbs `LLMInvokeOptions.signal` through to `fetch(..., { signal })` / SDK `{ signal }` options. New `__tests__/patterns/ai/adapters/abort-propagation.test.ts` covers every provider × `{invoke, stream}` cell — 15 tests post-/qa pass (8 invoke + 7 stream — qa D1 follow-up added stream-path coverage so `valve` / `switchMap` / inline-edit consumers get the same lock-test treatment).
    - **Batch B — Tier 6 reconciliation regression tests.** Three new tests in `__tests__/patterns/harness.test.ts` lock invariants previously marked as "landed by inspection only": Tier 6.1 `__unrouted` dead-letter (items with unknown routes flow into `__unrouted`); Tier 6.2 foreign-node-accept gate composition (qa P2 strengthened: identity equality + describe-walk dep verification — gate's deps point at the hub topic's canonical path, not a wrapper); Tier 6.4 structural-branch verifyResults publish (qa P4 strengthened: count assertions lock "exactly one verdict, no extra").
    - **Batch C — Tier 9.1 /qa carry polish.** EH-9: `validateNoIslands` filters synthetic `__internal__/` paths from the orphan list (`graph/validate-no-islands.ts:104`); qa P6 added a real-synthetic regression that drives the `graph.ts:1959` transitive-walk synthesis path. EH-12: `bumpCursor` emits a one-shot `console.warn` when restoring from a non-numeric cursor cache (`extra/mutation/index.ts:205`); qa P5 generalized the message to also cover malformed-initial-seed. Per-cursor `WeakSet` dedupe so warnings fire exactly once per node. EH-18: `AuditTrailGraph.includeTypes` exposed as readonly `Set<AuditEntry["type"]>` field (`patterns/inspect/audit.ts:107`); qa P1 fixed the default-singleton sharing hazard — every default-using audit owns a fresh clone, JSDoc tightened to drop the false "frozen" claim.
    - **Batch D — Tier 6.5 invariant regression tests.** Three focused tests: §35 reentrancy invariant (synchronous mock cascade through reingest produces exactly one structural + one verified verdict, no double-publish); reflectNode tick count ≡ verdict count (qa P3 tightened bound from `+2` to `+1` so a 1-tick over-count regression actually fails); async-evaluator §9a coverage (evaluator emits across microtask boundaries with sentinel initial cache; qa D3 widened `state<T>(initial?: T)` to a zero-arg overload — `state<T>()` is now the canonical "no value yet" sugar, replacing both the `state<T>(undefined as unknown as T)` cast workaround and the briefly-shipped `sentinelState<T>()` factory which was removed during the deviation-audit pass per `feedback_no_backward_compat`). qa D4 added `harness.reflect` typed field; rename-drift-resistant subscribe replaces the `harness.node("reflect")` string lookup.
    - **Verification.** 2537 tests passing (+1 from a new `state(null)` distinction test that locks `null` cache vs. sentinel form; +29 over Tier 9.1 baseline); build green (assertBrowserSafeBundles passes); lint clean at 9-warning baseline; `docs:gen` regenerated `state.md` + removed `sentinelState.md` (moved to `TRASH/`).

16. ✅ Residual backlog tier-by-tier cleanup (2026-04-29, single session). Five tiers locked + applied + verified across one continuous push. **Working test count over the session: 2540 → 2550 (+10 regression tests; no deletions; all green throughout).** Lint clean, build green, `assertBrowserSafeBundles` honored at every stage.

   - **Tier R1 — Foundational / protocol-level.**
     - **R1.4 derivedT/effectT typed-tuple variants** ✅ landed. Added [`derivedT<TDeps extends readonly Node<unknown>[], TOut>`](src/core/sugar.ts:194) + [`effectT<TDeps>`](src/core/sugar.ts:248) propagating dep value types into the callback's `data` tuple — eliminates per-callsite `as` casts at consumer sites (memory-composers had 6 such cast points). Barrel re-exported via [src/core/index.ts:74–93](src/core/index.ts:74). Two regression tests in [sugar.test.ts](src/__tests__/core/sugar.test.ts).
     - **R1.5 Graph._destroyClearOnly disposer drain (EH-2)** ✅ landed. [graph.ts:3349–3370](src/graph/graph.ts:3349) drains both `_disposers` and `_storageDisposers` mirroring the full `destroy()` path so child mounts that registered disposers via `addDisposer` no longer leak when destruction reaches the subtree via parent TEARDOWN cascade. EH-2 regression test in [graph.test.ts](src/__tests__/graph/graph.test.ts) verifies disposers fire at every mount depth.
     - **R1.2 RESOLVED tier-3 wave-exclusivity rule** ✅ locked at the spec + comp-guide level (no runtime enforcement per user call). [`~/src/graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md`](../graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md) §1.3.3 amended; [`~/src/graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md`](../graphrefly/COMPOSITION-GUIDE.md) §41 added with author-facing rule + violation examples; [filter JSDoc](src/extra/operators/index.ts) references the rule. The spec amendment makes explicit that within any single wave at any single node, the tier-3 slot is either ≥1 `DATA` *or* exactly 1 `RESOLVED` — never mixed, including across multiple `actions.emit` calls within one `batch()` frame.
     - **R1.1 Three-layer view model architecture lock** — confirmed (no code change). `describe()` covers Layer 1 (topology), `observe()` covers Layer 2 (data), Layer 3 (functions) intentionally hidden. Future `topologyView(graph)` factory composes existing `describe({reactive: true | "diff"})` + `observe({reactive: true})` primitives. **Renderer extraction was pre-shipped:** `toMermaid` / `toAscii` / `toD2` / `toPretty` / `toJson` / `toMermaidUrl` are public at `@graphrefly/graphrefly/extra/render` (graph.ts:546–550). Implementation deferred to its own pattern PR.

   - **Tier R2 — Real-bug-fixes + 2.5 design session lock.**
     - **R2.1 DF2 retry COMPLETE-then-ERROR re-entrant timer** ✅ landed. [resilience/index.ts:219–231](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:219) sets `stopped = true` BEFORE `disconnectUpstream()` so a re-entrant ERROR delivered same-wave can't escape the `if (stopped) return` guard at line 159 and schedule a new retry timer.
     - **R2.2 trackingKey collision JSDoc lock** ✅ landed. [_internal/index.ts:44–87](src/patterns/_internal/index.ts:44) + [harness/types.ts:77–87](src/patterns/harness/types.ts:77) — caller contract: `summary` uniqueness OR explicit `relatedTo[0]` carrier. Single-threaded JS makes typical structural-failure path safe; multi-publisher concurrency or batched intake of identical-summary items can race without the contract.
     - **R2.3 DF6 source-mode retry resubscribable opt-in warn** ✅ landed. [resilience/index.ts:303–325](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:303) once-per-source `console.warn` (WeakSet dedupe mirrors `_bumpCursorWarned` precedent) when `_resubscribable === false`. Misconfigurations fail loud at construction without log spam.
     - **R2.4 DF13 Graph.explain overload narrowing** ✅ landed. [graph.ts:2174–2206](src/graph/graph.ts:2174) static overload `opts` type narrowed to forbid `reactive: true`, steering callers into the reactive overload at the type level instead of through the implementation signature's union return.
     - **R2.5 Pump-layer inflight teardown drain + signal threading (locked option C in 9-question session).** Two-PR shape:
       - **R2.5a (PR1)** ✅ landed. [job-queue/index.ts:476–588](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:476) — JobFlow pump tracks `Set<{unsub, ac: AbortController}>` per-claim in `ctx.store.inflight`; pump's `deactivate` cleanup hook drains all entries (abort + unsub) on parent Graph TEARDOWN. Closes the leak where in-flight LLM streams / refineLoop iterations / evaluator subgraphs survived past `harness.destroy()`. Stress test in [messaging.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/messaging.test.ts).
       - **R2.5b (PR2)** ✅ landed. `WorkFn<T>` widened to `(job, opts?: { signal: AbortSignal }) => NodeInput<T>` mirroring the established `LLMInvokeOptions.signal` / `apply(item, {signal})` / tool-handler precedent. `HarnessExecutor<A>` / `HarnessVerifier<A>` types updated. `_oneShotLlmCall` accepts `parentSignal?: AbortSignal` and links to its inner AC (parent abort cascades). `defaultLlmExecutor` / `defaultLlmVerifier` / `actuatorExecutor` migrated to forward `opts.signal`. Sync work fns ignore `opts` — backwards-compat preserved.
     - **R2.6 + R3.4 EH-17 + γ-7-A processManager wrapMutation migration** ✅ landed. User locked the more-aggressive option: full `wrapMutation` migration. [process/index.ts:451–528](src/patterns/process/index.ts:451) — `appendRecord` helper migrated from `lightMutation` to `wrapMutation` (closes EH-17 re-entrancy: `instances.entries` subscriber synchronously triggering another `appendRecord` no longer interleaves on the audit log because downstream delivery defers until the outer batch commits). [process/index.ts:912–937](src/patterns/process/index.ts:912) — `start()` now backed by a `wrapMutation` factory `startInternal`; synthetic `_appendEvent` runs INSIDE the batch frame; if event stream is terminated, batch rolls back (audit append + seq advance discarded) and error propagates to caller. Pre-1.0 behavior change vs. γ-7-B's swallow-on-emit-error semantics — explicitly accepted per user lock. Per COMPOSITION-GUIDE §35, closure mutations deferred to AFTER `_appendEvent` succeeds since rollback doesn't undo them.

   - **Tier R3 — Primitive-contract widening + design session 3.2.**
     - **R3.1 JobFlow stage `maxInflight` cap** ✅ landed. [job-queue/index.ts:362–550](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:362) — additive `StageDef.maxInflight?: number` per-stage option distinct from `maxPerPump`. When set, mounts a per-stage `state(0)` counter as a pump dep so settles re-fire the pump (otherwise the pump only fires on `pending` changes; `ack` doesn't change pending → would deadlock at saturation). Counter increments on claim, decrements on settle; pump-loop gates on `inflight.size >= maxInflightCap`. Composes naturally with `maxPerPump`. Stress test in [messaging.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/messaging.test.ts) covers 5 jobs with cap=2.
     - **R3.2 Reactive-options primitive widening (5-primitive batch)** ✅ landed across resilience family. Locked semantics per primitive (9-question session option A — single batch):
       - New `NodeOrValue<T>` type + `resolveReactiveOption<T>(arg, onChange?)` helper at [resilience/index.ts:1199–1255](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:1199) — closure-mirror per COMPOSITION-GUIDE §28.
       - **timeout** ([:1393–1473](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:1393)): `timeoutNs: NodeOrValue<number>`. Each `startTimer()` reads latest cache; option swap takes effect at **next attempt boundary** (in-flight timer keeps original deadline).
       - **retry** ([:142–402](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:142)): `opts: NodeOrValue<RetryOptions>`. `getCfg` invoked at every `scheduleRetryOrFinish`; **next attempt fails immediately if exhausted under new count**; `backoff` swap applies at next delay calc. Static-form opts still throw eagerly on construction (preserves Tier 3.1 footgun).
       - **rateLimiter** ([:959–1135](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:959)): `opts: NodeOrValue<RateLimiterOptions>`. On swap: rebuild bucket (tokens reset to new capacity), refill rate updates immediately, `maxBuffer` shrink **drops oldest** until size ≤ new cap, `onOverflow` swap takes effect at next overflow. **Mode toggling (bounded ↔ unbounded) NOT supported** (locked at construction).
       - **circuitBreaker** ([:476–613](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:476)): `options: NodeOrValue<CircuitBreakerOptions>`. **Option swap RESETS to `closed`** with all counters cleared (locked semantic for re-tuning a runaway breaker). New `breaker.dispose()` releases the option-Node subscription.
       - **budgetGate**: constraint **values** already reactive via `BudgetConstraint.node` (existing). Constraint **array shape** intentionally static (subscription churn overshoots fire-and-forget ergonomics). JSDoc updated at [budget-gate.ts:156–177](src/extra/resilience/budget-gate.ts:156) to make the locked semantic explicit.
       - 4 swap-behavior tests added at [resilience.test.ts:1066–1170](src/__tests__/extra/resilience.test.ts:1066) — one per widened primitive (timeout / retry / rateLimiter / circuitBreaker).
     - **R3.3 EH-16 processManager.dispose() mount-based cleanup (option b locked)** ✅ landed. [process/index.ts:475–490](src/patterns/process/index.ts:475) — audit log + seq cursor now under per-instance subgraph mounted at `__processManagers__/${name}`. `dispose()` calls `cqrsGraph.remove(...)` for clean unmount via the existing mount/removeMount lifecycle. Repeated create/dispose cycles no longer leak nodes on the cqrsGraph indefinitely. Path-schema change (pre-1.0 break): `${name}_process_instances` / `${name}_process_seq` (top-level) → `__processManagers__/${name}::instances` / `::seq` (mounted). Regression test in [process.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/process.test.ts) verifies repeated cycles leave no leaked nodes.
     - **R3.5 processManager state-snapshot persistence (`stateStorage`)** ✅ landed. New [`ProcessStateSnapshot<TState>`](src/patterns/process/index.ts:139–157) type + [`processStateKeyOf`](src/patterns/process/index.ts:160) export. New `persistence.stateStorage?: KvStorageTier<ProcessStateSnapshot<TState>>[]` option saves on every transition (start / step success / step terminate); deletes on terminal transitions (terminated / errored / compensated). New `restore(): Promise<number>` method on `ProcessManagerResult` loads from first tier and rehydrates running instances. Two round-trip tests in [process.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/process.test.ts).

   - **Tier R4 — Observability / describe-explain completeness.**
     - **R4.2 EC7 meta companion `resubscribable` propagation** ✅ landed. [core/node.ts:715–733](src/core/node.ts:715) — meta companions now inherit `resubscribable` from parent. A `resubscribable: true` parent's `withStatus.status` / `withBreaker.breakerState` / `rateLimiter.droppedCount` companion now correctly accepts post-terminal-reset re-emissions (defeated by the prior closure-only setup).
     - **R4.1 (option B) + R4.3 (option B) memoryWithTiers refactor + closure-state promotion** ✅ landed as one bundled PR. [memory-composers.ts:191–352](src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:191) fully rewritten — `memoryWithTiers(graph, source, extractFn, opts)` is now the **construction site** for the distill bundle (breaking API change vs. pre-refactor; `agentMemory` updated at [agent-memory.ts:248–276](src/patterns/ai/presets/agent-memory.ts:248) to branch on `opts.tiers` — tiers configured → memoryWithTiers; tiers omitted → distill direct). `reactiveMap.retention` wired at distill-construction time eliminates the §7 feedback cycle the prior `tierClassifier` effect carried (archival now happens synchronously inside the substrate's mutation pipeline, no separate effect with its own subscription writing back to its own dep). `permanentKeys` and `entryCreatedAtNs` promoted from closure Maps to mounted `reactiveMap` bundles ([:255–264](src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:255)) — visible to `describe()` / `explain()` so debug "why was X archived?" is now traceable. `retention.score` returns `Infinity` for permanent matches (bypasses eviction); separate permanent-promotion effect upserts into `permanent` collection without writing to the active store (no §7 cycle there). Regression test at [ai.test.ts](src/__tests__/patterns/ai.test.ts) verifies (a) below-threshold entries archive synchronously via retention; (b) `permanentKeys` / `entryCreatedAtNs` paths are reachable.
     - **R4.4–R4.6** parked (consumer/bug-driven): structural→reingest topology edge (blocked on reactive bounded counter primitive); DF14 SENTINEL-aware state factory (round-trip use case); EH-19 `validateNoIslandsReactive` (continuous-validation consumer).

   - **Tier R5 — Cleanup / migration / documentation batch.**
     - **R5.1 `extends Graph` consistency sweep** — DEFERRED. Validated only 2 holdouts (`RefineLoopGraph`, `AgentMemoryGraph`) and zero `instanceof` consumers in-tree. The constructor-migration cost (especially RefineLoopGraph's `setStrategy`/`pause`/`resume` methods referencing factory-local node closures) outweighs the cosmetic gain for now. Doc comment added at [agent-memory.ts:321](src/patterns/ai/presets/agent-memory.ts:321) noting the deferral and the migration trigger ("when a future consumer needs `instanceof` narrowing").
     - **R5.2 GateController.node → output rename (EC6 migration)** ✅ landed. [pipeline-graph.ts:80–98, 509–520](src/patterns/orchestration/pipeline-graph.ts:80) — public bundle property renamed to avoid shadowing `Graph.node(name)` when a gate is accessed off a `PipelineGraph` instance. Pre-1.0 break. All 11 callsites updated: streaming.ts, harness-loop.ts:663 (the post-gate route output for executeInput merge), 9 sites in orchestration.test.ts, 1 site in phase5-llm-composition.test.ts.
     - **R5.3 Website API docs registry expansion** ✅ landed. [website/scripts/gen-api-docs.mjs:286–311](website/scripts/gen-api-docs.mjs:286) — added 16 entries across the 5 Phase 4+ pattern domains: `topic` / `messagingHub` / `subscription` / `topicBridge` (messaging); `pipelineGraph` / `decisionKeyOf` (orchestration); `jobQueue` / `jobFlow` / `jobEventKeyOf` (job-queue); `cqrs` / `cqrsEventKeyOf` / `dispatchKeyOf` / `sagaInvocationKeyOf` (cqrs); `processManager` / `processInstanceKeyOf` / `processStateKeyOf` (process).
     - **R5.4 `mapFromSnapshot` stale doc fix** ✅ landed. [memory-composers.ts:59–73](src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:59) — corrected the stale comment that referenced the deleted `extractStoreMap` helper. (`mapFromSnapshot` itself is load-bearing for the codec-round-trip safety net per the Tier 9.1 D2 fix; this is doc-only.)
     - **R5.5 reactiveExtractFn migration audit** ✅ clean. Both production `distill()` callers (memory-composers.ts:300 in the new memoryWithTiers, agent-memory.ts:271 in the no-tiers branch) use the AM.0 `(rawNode, existingNode) => NodeInput<Extraction>` shape. No code changes.
     - **R5.6 (option b) `decompileSpec` hard-require compound-factory tagging** ✅ landed. [graphspec/index.ts:1107–1141](src/patterns/graphspec/index.ts:1107) — throws on untagged `parent::child` topology where the parent path is in the graph but lacks `meta.factory`. Skips known infrastructure prefixes (meta companions, `__feedback_effect_`, `__bridge_`). All in-tree compound factories already tagged correctly; tests pass without modification.
     - **R5.7 doc-only micro-fix batch** ✅ landed. DF3 — HeadIndexQueue claim tightened to "worst-case ~3× live size" (`budget-gate.ts:50`); DF8 — `withStatus` per-subscribe `pending → running → completed → pending → running …` thrash semantic locked as intended fresh-cycle behavior with consumer guidance (`resilience/index.ts:1267`); DF11 — `placeholderArgs` `undefined`-key `JSON.stringify` drop documented as unavoidable JSON-boundary disagreement with substitute-explicit-sentinel guidance (`core/meta.ts:106`).

   **Cumulative deferred / parked items** (consumer-driven; surface when demand arrives):
   - Tier R3.6 (refineLoop persistent re-seed `setSeed` / `reset`)
   - Tier R3.7 (`executeAndVerify` unified harness slot)
   - Tier R3.8 (`actuatorExecutor` `mode` option `supersede`/`queue`/`drop`)
   - Tier R4.4 (structural→reingest topology edge — blocked on reactive bounded counter primitive)
   - Tier R4.5 (DF14 `describeNode` specMode SENTINEL preservation)
   - Tier R4.6 (`validateNoIslandsReactive` continuous-validation companion)
   - Tier R5.1 (`extends Graph` migration for `RefineLoopGraph` + `AgentMemoryGraph`)
   - Tier 1.1 follow-on `topologyView(graph)` factory (architecture locked; pattern-PR sized)
   - Companion Nodes from Tier R3.2 design session: `budgetState` / `retryAttempts` / `lastTimeout` (additive observability; ship when consumer asks)
   - Spec-level enforcement of Tier R1.2 RESOLVED wave-exclusivity (locked at doc level only per user call; runtime `_emit` rejection deferred)
   - Tier R4.1 §7 cycle removal at the simpler shape — ALREADY shipped (R4.1 option B landed in this session)

17. ✅ /qa pass on the residual-backlog batch (2026-04-29). Adversarial review by parallel Blind Hunter + Edge Case Hunter subagents; ~24 raw findings deduplicated to 5 patches + 5 deferrals. All 5 patches landed in the same /qa cycle; all 5 deferrals filed in [docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md) under "QA follow-ups from residual-backlog /qa pass":
    - **F-A** ✅ stale doc reference `gate.node` → `gate.output` in [streaming.ts:391](src/patterns/ai/prompts/streaming.ts:391) (rename cleanup missed by R5.2).
    - **F-D** ✅ JobFlow `inflight_${stage}` counter renamed to `__inflight__/${stage}` ([job-queue/index.ts:520–531](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:520)) — internal-namespace prefix prevents collision with user-named stages, matches the EH-16 `__processManagers__/<name>` convention (COMPOSITION-GUIDE §38).
    - **F-E** ✅ `derivedT` / `effectT` typing soundness — `opts` parameter narrowed to `Omit<NodeOptions<TOut>, "partial"> & { partial?: false }` ([sugar.ts:222–230, 266–272](src/core/sugar.ts:222)). Callers needing `partial: true` now correctly steered to untyped `derived` / `effect` where `data: readonly unknown[]` is sound and the `=== undefined` guard is sanctioned (§3 partial-true exception).
    - **F-F** ✅ JobFlow pump `inflightCounter.emit` guarded with `terminated` flag in `ctx.store.inflight` ([job-queue/index.ts:566–569, 634–638, 700](src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:566)). Prevents the late-ERROR/DATA arriving via the deferred-microtask `Promise.resolve().then(unsub?.())` path from emitting on a torn-down counter Node. Initial implementation also wrapped the claim loop in `batch(() => …)` to coalesce per-claim emits but that broke `actuator-executor.test.ts` end-to-end (subscribe-callback nested-batch interactions in the harness's executeFlow chain); the optimization was reverted, the correctness guard kept.
    - **F-C** ✅ rateLimiter reactive `maxBuffer` grow rejected with `console.warn` ([resilience/index.ts:1078–1086](src/extra/resilience/index.ts:1078)). The pending RingBuffer is allocated at construction; growing the cap reactively would let the overflow check pass more pushes than the ring's actual capacity → `RingBuffer.push` silently overwrites oldest, bypassing the `dropped` counter and `onOverflow: "error"` arm. Reactive `maxBuffer` is now monotonically non-increasing; shrinking still drops-oldest as documented.
    - 5 deferrals filed: D1 (`retention.score` re-entrant write into `entryCreatedAtNs`); D2 (`processManager.start()` `persistState` outside rollback boundary); D3 (`processManager.restore()` await-boundary race with watch handlers); D4 (rateLimiter Node-form opts with `undefined` cache locks bounded mode); D5 (`processManager.restore()` mid-dispose race).
    - **Verification.** 2550 tests pass, lint clean, build green (`assertBrowserSafeBundles` honored throughout).

18. **Tiers 1–10 closed (2026-04-29).** Tier 9.2 `classifyError` deferred (no caller). Optimizations.md residual backlog substantively cleared via item 16. The next stretch of pre-1.0 work is captured below as **Phases 11–16**, locked 2026-04-30 — see "Pre-1.0 remaining work" section.

---

## Pre-1.0 remaining work (sequenced 2026-04-30)

This section sequences all remaining open work from `docs/optimizations.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and the two latest session docs (`archive/docs/SESSION-human-llm-intervention-primitives.md` + `archive/docs/SESSION-multi-agent-gap-analysis.md`). **Implementation-plan.md is canonical from this point forward**; `docs/roadmap.md` is retained as the vision/wave context document. `docs/optimizations.md` continues to track item-level provenance (each phase entry below cross-references the optimizations.md anchor).

### Re-prioritization (locked 2026-04-30)

1. **Phase 11 — Cleanup batch.** Reduce deferred-item backlog before opening multi-agent. Real bugs + mechanical carries land; "wait-for-consumer" items get a hard look ("does multi-agent surface the consumer?").
2. **Phase 12 — Consolidation closure.** Cross-cutting refactors that affect surface area: `io/` body extraction, sibling-file relocation, `extends Graph` sweep (gates Phase 13.G/H), `promptNode` B.3 widening.
3. **Phase 13 — Multi-agent + intervention substrate.** Recovers the multi-agent gap-analysis doc (13.A — DO FIRST), lands Phase 0 substrate (envelope + topics + composers), then the agent layer (G1–G4), then `spawnable()` (G3).
4. **Phase 14 — Post-1.0 changesets / diff (single unified design session).** Op-log changesets + worker-bridge wire-protocol B + `lens.flow` delta + `reactiveLog.scan` + WAL replay for `restoreSnapshot mode: "diff"`. Co-designed because they share the version-counter substrate.
5. **Phase 14.5 — Roadmap residuals.** Pre-1.0 polish unblocked by Phase 13 (`refineExecutor`, `toolInterceptor` sugar, `mockLLM` promotion); Phase 7.6 verification pass; surfacing items that flow to Phase 16 (framework packages, demo deck) or Parked (Phase 8.x scale, Phase 6.x content addressing depth, Phase 7.4/7.5 quality hardening).
6. **Phase 15 — Eval program.** Pushed AFTER core / extras / graph / patterns / solutions stabilize (post-Phase-13). Two-tier (synthetic + human-graded) eval design + catalog automation + harness scorecard + eval adapter stack migration.
7. **Phase 16 — Launch wave.** MCP server, CLI surface, OpenClaw context engine plugin, demos (Demo 0 / Demo 2 multi-agent / Demo 6 / inbox-stream), framework infiltration packages, npm publish, README + docs site. Lands when Phase 15 ships.
8. **Parked until 1.0:** PY parity (umbrella), Path X (Node-returning mutations), G10 atomic registry hot-swap, codec lazy decode, dormant subgraph eviction, AG-UI / A2UI translation adapters, Phase 8.5 distributed (peerGraph / shardedGraph), Phase 8.6 pluggable codec, Phase 8.8 memory optimization, Phase 6.x content-addressing depth, Phase 7.3 Demos 1/3/4/5/7, Phase 7.4 scenario tests, Phase 7.5 inspection stress.

### Sequencing rationale

```
Phase 11 — cleanup ──────┐
                         ├──→ Phase 13 — multi-agent ──→ Phase 14 — changesets/diff ──→ Phase 14.5 — residuals ──→ Phase 15 — eval ──→ Phase 16 — launch
Phase 12 — consolidation ┤                                                               │
                         │                                                               ├──→ (some items co-land in Phase 16; demoted to Parked)
                         └──→ (12.D `extends Graph` sweep gates Phase 13.G/H AgentGraph)  │
                                                                                          └──→ (refineExecutor / toolInterceptor land inline with Phase 13 if consumers surface)

Parked: PY parity (until 1.0); Path X (blocked); G10 (rewire-gap dependent); codec lazy decode (post-1.0); Phase 8.x scale + memory; Phase 6.x content addressing; Phase 7.3+ post-launch demos.
```

**Critical-path note:** Phase 13.A (recover `SESSION-multi-agent-gap-analysis.md` to `archive/docs/`) is the FIRST operation — without it, future agents cannot pick up the locked G1–G4 decisions. ✅ **Landed 2026-04-30** along with this plan.

---

### Phase 11 — Cleanup batch (deferred-item roll-up) ✅ landed (2026-04-30) — DONE items archived

DONE items from §11.1–§11.10 archived to [archive/roadmap/phase-11-cleanup.jsonl](../archive/roadmap/phase-11-cleanup.jsonl) (ids `phase-11.1-class-ab-migration-qa-carries` … `phase-11.10-operator-layer-resolved`). Headline landings: bridge `=== undefined` migration + topic-empty SENTINEL fix (EC2/EC7); `${name}-state` separator (EC17); `TopicGraph` self-resolve fix; partial:false withLatestFrom regression tests (P11.5-D1); `maxInflight` per-stage cap (R3.1); `Graph._destroyClearOnly` disposer drain (EH-2); `wrapMutation` migration for `processManager` + messaging (γ-7-A, R2.6); rateLimiter/breaker/timeout/retry/fallback reactive-options widening (R3.2) + `meta` forwarding (D8) + `rateLimitState` companion (D7); Wave 2B DF1–DF13 cluster; Tier 1.5.3 F15/F18/F24/F25; Wave AM AM.0–AM.3 + `memoryWithTiers` refactor; DS-11.10 operator-layer review resolved by spec §1.3.3 + COMPOSITION-GUIDE §41.

`optimizations.md` remains the source of truth for per-item context. The list below is the **WAIT / POST-1.0 carries that remain open** — i.e. consumer-driven follow-ups that did NOT land in the cleanup batch and stay in flight. New WAIT items added here should map to a fresh sub-bullet OR file under Phase 14.5 / Parked.

#### Open WAIT carries (consumer-driven, not landed in Phase 11)
- **WAIT:** M4 + EC3/EC4/EC12-14 — `MemoryRetrievalGraph` per-input subgraph + state crosstalk + anonymous internal nodes. **Re-evaluate when a multi-agent retrieval consumer surfaces.**
- **WAIT:** M7 — saga `audit === invocations` aliasing. Defer until security review need.
- **WAIT:** M8 — `singleNodeFromAny` keepalive-for-DATA-only-nodes. Pre-existing; JSDoc documents the contract.
- **WAIT:** M10 — `pipelineGraph.approvalGate` cross-graph batch order. Bundles with §28 framework cleanup.
- **WAIT:** EC10/EC15 — strategy ownership doc. JSDoc-only when next harness touch.
- **WAIT:** P11.5-D2 — multi-emit through `graph.derived` end-to-end test. Until consumer needs it.
- **WAIT:** P11.5-D3 — `verifiable` trigger-before-source-DATA semantic pin. Until consumer hits new behavior.
- **WAIT:** C1–C2 (graph.batch throw, keepAlive cache) — pre-existing core-batch / RAM-cache semantics; documented.
- **WAIT:** C3 — cross-graph Node ownership via `Graph.add`. `produce` already partially mitigates; full guard defers until dual-ownership consumer hits.
- **PARKED:** C4 — path-based `graph.derived` reaches across mounts. Tied to `project_rewire_gap` (G10 parked).
- **WAIT:** Structural→reingest topology edge — blocked on reactive bounded counter primitive.
- **WAIT:** Per-claim eval-verifier subgraph mounting story. Bundles with Phase 15.
- **WAIT:** EH-19 — `validateNoIslands` reactive companion. Ship when 10k-node continuous-validation consumer surfaces.
- **WAIT:** Messaging audit-record schemas (γ-5 / γ-6). Defer until real audit consumer surfaces in messaging.
- **WAIT:** Companion Nodes `budgetState` / `retryAttempts` / `lastTimeout` — additive observability.
- **WAIT:** EC5 `audit-no-effect` lint reactivity; EC7 meta companion `resubscribable` propagation — landed R4.2; doc-only delta remains.
- **WAIT:** F8 `as Node<Actor>` cast; F9 `graphLens.flow` reconciliation O(N) — bundle with `graphLens` 50k-node scaling (10.8 design follow-up).
- **WAIT:** DF4 — HeadIndexQueue `undefined`-write V8 deopt. Needs profiler before changing.
- **WAIT:** DF5 — rateLimiter `droppedCount` activation-time emit when no subscriber. Design call deferred.
- **WAIT:** DF14 — `describeNode` specMode SENTINEL preservation. Needs SENTINEL-aware state factory.
- **POST-1.0:** DF7 PY parity policyGate.
- **WAIT:** F16/F17 — `_describeReactiveDiff` empty-graph + race. Observable transient; doc-only.
- **WAIT:** F19/F20/F21/F22/F23 — minor consistency items in `withStatus` / `factoryTag` / `tap` / `switchMap` / `metaEqual`; no consumer.
- **WAIT:** `diffMap<K, V>` operator extraction. Wait for third consumer (Tier 10.2).
- **WAIT:** Tier R3.6 `refineLoop` persistent re-seed `setSeed` / `reset`.
- **WAIT:** Tier R3.7 `executeAndVerify` unified harness slot.
- **WAIT:** Tier R3.8 `actuatorExecutor` `mode: supersede|queue|drop`; `dispose` hook + late-resolution suppression.
- **WAIT:** `appendLogStorage.loadEntries` pagination cursor.
- **WAIT:** MCP session graph-registry race (`packages/mcp-server/src/tools.ts`) under future HTTP/SSE transports.
- **WAIT:** Demo Flow chapter useEffect-owned rAF subscription. Pragmatic shape until a second physics-integrator consumer.
- **POST-1.0:** `withStatus` decomposition into `statusOf` + `errorOf`.
- **POST-1.0:** `processManager` lone `queueMicrotask` cleanup. Soft-violation, defensive.
- **POST-1.0:** `actuatorExecutor` migrate to protocol ERROR when Path X lands. Path X is parked.
- **POST-1.0:** Surface `restoreSnapshot` rejects `mode: "diff"` records (Tier 10.6). Bundles with Phase 14.

### Phase 12 — Consolidation closure (cross-cutting refactors) ✅ landed (2026-04-30) — archived

Body archived to [archive/roadmap/phase-12-consolidation.jsonl](../archive/roadmap/phase-12-consolidation.jsonl) (ids `phase-12-consolidation-batch`, `phase-12-qa-pass`).

Single batch covering 12.A `io/` body extraction (markup-only — `extra/io/index.ts` now a 98-LOC barrel + 30+ per-protocol sub-files; landed in commit `0dc5f9e`); 12.B sibling-file relocation (18 files moved into `composition/` / `data-structures/` / `storage/` / `io/` / `resilience/` with 1-line re-export shims at top level); 12.C `promptNode` B.3 widening (verify-only — `::messages` / `::output` / `::response` topology already in code); 12.D `extends Graph` sweep (`RefineLoopGraph` + `AgentMemoryGraph` migrated to `class extends Graph`; unblocks Phase 13.G `AgentBundle.graph: AgentGraph<TIn, TOut>` with `instanceof` narrowing). 2646 tests passing; build green; lint clean.

/qa pass (2026-05-01) auto-applied 7 patches — A1/A2/A3 constructor field-order + tagFactory parity, D1 `RefineLoopGraph.decideEffect` resume-stall fix (eliminated 4 cross-node `.cache` reads via `CandidatesEnvelope<T>` + sole-owner sanction), D1 in-cycle extension (`tryIncrementBounded(counter, cap, by = 1)` generalization), D1 read-pattern refinement (sole-owner-in-same-enclosing-scope `.cache` reads sanctioned; closure mirrors removed; `pauseState` promoted to declared dep). Deferred items filed in [optimizations.md](optimizations.md) "QA follow-ups from Phase 12 /qa pass" (D1 wrapEvaluator, B2 tiers-branch path divergence, B3 intra-extra/ imports route through legacy shims, B4 nodeOnlyEntries comment, B5a–g minor items).

### Phase 13 — Multi-agent + intervention substrate ✅ closed (2026-05-01) — archived

Body archived to [archive/roadmap/phase-13-multi-agent.jsonl](../archive/roadmap/phase-13-multi-agent.jsonl) (ids `phase-13-multi-agent-batch`, `phase-13-qa-pass`).

All 13 sub-units (A–M) shipped in one batch: 13.A recovered the multi-agent gap-analysis design doc; 13.B `Message<T>` envelope + standard topic constants (`PROMPTS_TOPIC` / `RESPONSES_TOPIC` / `INJECTIONS_TOPIC` / `DEFERRED_TOPIC` / `SPAWNS_TOPIC`); 13.C `selector` + `materialize` composers in `extra/composition/`; 13.D recipe docs (cross-repo edits to COMPOSITION-GUIDE-PATTERNS.md §41–§43 — criteria-grid verifier, cost-bubble, boundaryDrain); 13.E `valve` `abortInFlight` opt; 13.F `humanInput<T>` + `tracker` sibling presets (orchestration/); 13.G `AgentBundle<TIn, TOut>` interface + `class AgentGraph extends Graph`; 13.H `agent(spec)` preset + `presetRegistry` sugar; 13.I `spawnable()` harness preset + strategy-key axis extension (`StrategyKey = ${PresetId}|${RootCause}→${Intervention}` with `DEFAULT_PRESET_ID = "default"`); 13.J `boundaryDrain` locked as recipe; 13.K G6 cross-graph `explain()` validation (5 tests; topicBridge end-to-end gap filed in optimizations.md); 13.L `settle<T>` operator (reactive form of `awaitSettled`); 13.M worked multi-agent example test (lock-test). 2734 tests pass (+88 over Phase 12 baseline); build green; lint clean.

/qa pass auto-applied 13 patches + N1(b) "agent input queue" architectural change (kicks queued through internal `topic<TIn>` + cursor `subscription` mounted under AgentGraph; drain effect on `[inputSub.available, loop.status]`; eliminates raw-subscribe → kick re-entrancy hazard). See archive id `phase-13-qa-pass` for the full A1–A13 + N1(b) patch set.

**Outstanding:** 13.K `topicBridge` end-to-end `explain()` walk gap (filed in [optimizations.md](optimizations.md), deferred per user direction; defer until a real consumer hits it OR Phase 14 surfaces a general "imperative attach" representation).

**Source design docs:** `archive/docs/SESSION-human-llm-intervention-primitives.md` + `archive/docs/SESSION-multi-agent-gap-analysis.md` (both locked 2026-04-28).

**Open follow-up design sessions** (queued for the post-Phase-13 wave): (a) `AgentSpec` `meta` escape hatch, (b) handoff context-transfer ergonomics, (c) verifier slot type widening.

### Phase 13.5 — Locked design sessions awaiting implementation

*Source: post-Phase-13 triage session 2026-05-01. All sub-sections fully locked in **DS-13.5 lock-down session 2026-05-01** (this session).*

Single home for design sessions that are decision-locked or scoped but not yet implemented. Each sub-section is self-contained — no need to cross-reference session docs to revisit them. **Implementation runs in dedicated sessions before Phase 14 opens** so the changesets/delta substrate composes against a clean protocol + primitive surface.

**Per-DS implementation sub-plans** at `docs/implementation-plan-DS-13.5/<DS>.md` — each file self-contained for handoff to an unfamiliar implementer. They include locked decisions, COMPOSITION-GUIDE pointers, files-to-touch, watch-outs, ACs, and required tests.

**Lock-down session insights folded back into canonical guidance:**
- COMPOSITION-GUIDE-PATTERNS L2 §44 — `T | Node<T>` parameter widening (when not to make a primitive). Surfaced during DS-13.5.D walk; saved as a first-class principle.
- `StatusValue` central enum widened to `"pending" | "running" | "completed" | "errored" | "cancelled" | "paused"` (DS-13.5.B follow-on). `processManager` migrates `status: "compensated"` → `status: "cancelled"` (pre-1.0 internal break).
- `GateState` central enum to ship at `src/extra/resilience/gate-state.ts` as `"open" | "closed"` (DS-13.5.B follow-on).

#### DS-13.5.A — INVALIDATE protocol redesign (Bundle 1.5) — LOCKED Q1–Q16 (2026-05-01); core ✅ landed 2026-05-02 (Q5/Q10/Q12/Q14/PY-parity deferred)

*Trigger: Agent 5's `[[INVALIDATE], [RESOLVED]]` paired-reset pattern surfaced the deadlock (INVALIDATE alone leaves dependents DIRTY without settling). Reframe: promote INVALIDATE from tier-2 to its own tier-4 settle group between value-settle (tier-3 DATA/RESOLVED) and terminal (tier-5/6 COMPLETE/ERROR).*

**Core landed 2026-05-02 (TS only, no PY parity, no TLA+) — 2771 / 2771 tests pass:**
- Tier renumbering: INVALIDATE→4, COMPLETE/ERROR→5, TEARDOWN→6 (config.ts, batch.ts, node.ts up-validation, graph.ts checkpoint gate).
- INVALIDATE-settles-wave invariant: `_depInvalidated` decrements `_dirtyDepCount` (same role as RESOLVED).
- INVALIDATE transitions emitting node's status to `"sentinel"` (was `"dirty"`) — load-bearing for `defaultOnSubscribe`'s push-on-subscribe (sentinel pushes only `[START]`; dirty would push `[START, DIRTY]` and infect freshly-attached dep slots with phantom dirty count).
- Q9 same-wave INVALIDATE+INVALIDATE collapse (Q1/Q3 dropping rules retired during impl — natural tier-sort handles `[DATA(v), INVALIDATE]` correctly: cache cleared, both delivered).
- Q15 DIRTY auto-prefix extended to tier-4 INVALIDATE.
- Q7 PAUSE/RESUME bufferAll widened to include tier-4 INVALIDATE; drain emits per-entry to preserve cross-tier ordering.
- Q16 TEARDOWN auto-precede with `[COMPLETE]` (idempotent via `_teardownDone`; cleared on `_deactivate` so resubscribable nodes recover); atomic delivery for Q16-synthesized terminal-pairs in `downWithBatch` (sync AND in-batch).
- Migration: `agent-loop.ts` and `agents/agent.ts` paired-reset → plain `[[INVALIDATE]]`. `processManager.dispose()` manual COMPLETE workaround removed.
- Spec amendments in `~/src/graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md` §1.3 (tier table), §1.4 (INVALIDATE direction), §2.4a NEW (merge rules), §2.6 (Q16 TEARDOWN auto-precede + bufferAll per-entry drain).
- 13 new core tests in [src/__tests__/core/invalidate.test.ts](../src/__tests__/core/invalidate.test.ts) covering Q1/Q3/Q9 merges, Q16 atomicity + idempotency, INVALIDATE-settles-wave, `_terminalResult`-shape regression.
- /qa pass (2026-05-02) auto-applied 8 patches: A1 `_teardownDone` reset on resubscribable (CRITICAL), A2 Q16 sentinel-status guard loosening, A3–A5 spec wording (§2.4a equals order, §2.6 tier-4, §1.4 INVALIDATE upstream), A6 stale tier comments, A7 wireCrossing flip comment, A8 test strengthening.
- /qa Needs-Decision: N1 (DATA + INVALIDATE merge) → user picked "INVALIDATE wins via natural tier-sort" (Q1/Q3 explicit merges retired). N2 (Q16 atomicity inside batch) → extended. N3 (bufferAll INVALIDATE ordering) → per-entry drain. Root-cause for the 3 agentLoop abort-test regressions: INVALIDATE was setting `_status = "dirty"` instead of `"sentinel"`, infecting late-attaching dep slots via push-on-subscribe DIRTY. Fixed by the status-transition change above.
- /qa pass-2 (2026-05-03) auto-applied 6 patches (A1 spec §2.6 sentinel-allow-list, A2 `_teardownDone` defensive subscribe reset, A3 stale tier comments, A4 Q16 phase-4 atomicity doc, A5 3 protocol-level regression tests, A6 diamond fan-in invariant comment) plus N1 fix (resubscribable + INVALIDATE → fresh-lifecycle reset via new `_resetForFreshLifecycle()` helper shared between `subscribe()` and `_updateState`'s INVALIDATE branch). 2776 / 2776 tests pass post-fix.

**Deferred (additive, no consumer signal):**
- Q5 `data[i]` widening to `T[] | null | undefined` library-wide (mechanical; large surface).
- Q12 `invalidateWhenDepsInvalidate?: boolean` opt + sugar-layer auto-cascade (`undefined | null` returns).
- Q10 replay-buffer clearing on INVALIDATE.
- Q14 TLA+ `Invalidate` action + new invariants + MC config.
- Q14 fast-check `single-invalidate-settles` + `invalidate-merge-order-independent` properties.
- PY parity (per dev-dispatch scope decision 2026-05-02).

**Locked decisions (Q1–Q15):**

| Q | Decision |
|---|---|
| Q1 — DATA + INVALIDATE in same wave | DATA wins; source's `_cached` becomes the new DATA value. INVALIDATE's local cache-clear is a no-op when overridden. |
| Q2 — Cascade scope | Conservative: source's `_cached` clears; downstream's `prevData[source-slot]` resets to `undefined`; downstream's own `_cached` untouched. Caller still has access to last-computed value. |
| Q3 — RESOLVED + INVALIDATE in same wave | RESOLVED wins (it's the same-tier-as-DATA flow control; INVALIDATE is the tier-4 cleanup signal that doesn't override normal flow). |
| Q5 — `data[i]` shape encoding | Widen to `T[] \| null \| undefined`: `undefined` = no message from this dep this wave; `null` = INVALIDATE arrived; `[]` = RESOLVED (or silent under `partial: true`); `[v, ...]` = DATA values. |
| Q6 — INVALIDATE + COMPLETE/ERROR | Compose naturally via tier ordering. INVALIDATE cleanup fires, then terminal cascades. No special merge rule. |
| Q7 — INVALIDATE + PAUSE/RESUME | (a) Buffer alongside DATA; replay on RESUME in arrival order. JSDoc note: paused subscribers see deferred INVALIDATE on resume. |
| Q8 — INVALIDATE + equals substitution | INVALIDATE is not a value emission; equals never substitutes it. Always propagates. |
| Q9 — INVALIDATE inside `batch()` | Order-independent merge: DATA always wins (Q1); RESOLVED wins over INVALIDATE (Q3); INVALIDATE+INVALIDATE collapses to single (idempotent). |
| Q10 — INVALIDATE + replayBuffer | (a) INVALIDATE clears replay buffer too; late subscribers post-INVALIDATE see SENTINEL state, not stale history. **Loud JSDoc on the source/replayBuffer factory.** |
| Q11 — INVALIDATE + resubscribable | INVALIDATE does NOT trigger producer resubscription. Different concerns. |
| Q12 — Auto-cascade default | Reading A — only when a dep INVALIDATED in the wave AND fn doesn't emit (raw) / returns `undefined \| null` (sugars). New gate opt `invalidateWhenDepsInvalidate?: boolean` (default `true`). Symmetric with `errorWhenDepsError` / `completeWhenDepsComplete`. Sugar fn returning `[]` is NOT a trigger (explicit zero-emit, today's RESOLVED behavior). |
| Q13 — `NodeFnCleanup.invalidate?` hook | No change. Fires on dependent when INVALIDATE delivers (already shipped Package 6, 2026-04-23). |
| Q14 — TLA+ + fast-check coverage | Required: `Invalidate` action settles wave; new `InvalidateSettlesWave` invariant (counter test for the deadlock); `MergeRulesRespected` invariant (DATA wins / RESOLVED wins / INVALIDATE coalesces); update `EqualsFaithful` to confirm INVALIDATE bypasses substitution; fast-check single-INVALIDATE-settles + order-independent-merge properties. |
| Q15 — Spec amendment scope | §1.3 (tiers): add INVALIDATE as tier-4. §1.3.1 (auto-DIRTY-prefix): extend to INVALIDATE. §2.4: rewrite — settles wave; clears source `_cached`; resets dependent `prevData[slot]`; fires cleanup hook. §2.5: cross-ref Q10 (replayBuffer clears). §2.7: clarify `data[i] === null` as INVALIDATE-this-wave marker (orthogonal to `prevData[i] === undefined` SENTINEL). New §2.4a: merge rules table. New §5.13: `invalidateWhenDepsInvalidate` opt + cascade contract. |
| Q16 — TEARDOWN sequencing (added 2026-05-01 from process-manager dispose() implementation) | Framework auto-emits COMPLETE (or ERROR if the teardown is error-driven) **before** propagating TEARDOWN as the canonical teardown sequence — symmetric with the synthetic-DIRTY auto-prefix already in `_emit`. Resolves the class of bug where `firstWhere`/`firstValueFrom`-style bridges hang when their source is torn down via `Graph.remove` / `Graph.destroy` (TEARDOWN is tier-5 distinct from COMPLETE; firstWhere only handles DATA/ERROR/COMPLETE, so the awaiter never settles on TEARDOWN-only). Today's caller-side workaround: manually emit `node.down([[COMPLETE]])` before triggering the teardown cascade (see `processManager.dispose()` for an instance). Spec amendment: §2.6 (TEARDOWN semantics) gains an "auto-precede with COMPLETE/ERROR" rule; cascade implementation in `Graph._destroyClearOnly` and `Graph.remove` walks subtree nodes and emits the synthetic terminal. |

**Additional ungated questions (lean-locked, pending implementation):**

- `withStatus` interaction: stays in current status on INVALIDATE; defer `invalidated?: number` companion until consumer demand.
- `attachStorage` / WAL: persist INVALIDATE for replay determinism; spec amendment to §8.7.
- Worker bridge wire protocol: fold into DS-14 (bridge protocol changes anyway under changesets/delta work).
- Codec envelope (`Graph.snapshot()`): no change — codec writes whatever's in `_cached` at snapshot time; INVALIDATE-then-snapshot writes a SENTINEL slot naturally.

**Implementation scope:**
- `src/core/clock.ts`: add INVALIDATE to `messageTier` central config as tier-4.
- `src/core/node.ts`: `_emit` / `_frameBatch` / `_updateState` / `_maybeRunFnOnSettlement` — auto-DIRTY-prefix for INVALIDATE; INVALIDATE settles wave (decrements `_dirtyDepCount`); merge rules per Q1/Q3/Q9; `invalidateWhenDepsInvalidate` opt threading.
- Type widening: `data[i]: T[] | null | undefined`. Audit fn signatures library-wide.
- Sugar layer: `derived/effect/produce` recognize `undefined | null` return as auto-INVALIDATE trigger when paired with cascade default.
- Auto-INVALIDATE + replayBuffer clearing.
- `NodeFnCleanup.invalidate?` hook routing under new tier ordering — verify, no semantic change.
- Spec amendments per Q15 (cross-repo edit to `~/src/graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md`).
- TLA+ extensions per Q14 (cross-repo edit to `~/src/graphrefly/formal/wave_protocol.tla` + new MC).
- Fast-check invariants per Q14 (`src/__tests__/properties/_invariants.ts`).

**Migration / unwinds:**
- Agent 5's `[[INVALIDATE], [RESOLVED]]` paired-reset in `agent-loop.ts` simplifies to plain `[[INVALIDATE]]`.
- COMPOSITION-GUIDE §32 cross-wave reset section simplifies (no "remember to pair with RESOLVED" guidance).
- Audit other paired-reset callsites (refineLoop `lastFeedbackState` / `bestState` per the deferred SENTINEL sweep entry in optimizations.md) — they get the same simplification.

**Path X potential connection:** under the new model, per-attempt Nodes that emit INVALIDATE before going terminal might let late subscribers (retry's factory) see the cleanup signal — possibly a third path between the two existing options for the eager-keepalive vs `defaultOnSubscribe` blocker. Probe during implementation. See `optimizations.md` "Path X" entry's nested sub-bullet.

**Prerequisite for DS-14:** changesets/delta protocol composes against the new INVALIDATE substrate. DS-14 design assumes the new tier ordering and merge rules.

#### DS-13.5.B — Tier 5.2 reactive-options widening (5 primitives + companions) — FULLY LOCKED 2026-05-01; ✅ landed 2026-05-03 (TS; PY-parity deferred)

*Trigger: today's `resilientPipeline` rebuilds layers via switchMap on each opts emission, losing internal state (rate-limit pending buffer, breaker failure count, retry attempt count, in-flight timeout deadline). Widening primitives to accept `Node<Partial<Options>>` with rebind-on-emit lets state survive option swaps.*

**Strategy locks:**
- Split rebuild axis (mode change) from rebind axis (parameter tweak); per-primitive widening for both axes.
- `Node<Partial<Options>>` on emit; primitive merges with prior options.
- Empty `{}` emit is a no-op.
- Bundle return `<Primitive>Bundle<T>` (not bare `Node<T>`); pre-1.0 break.
- No sugar / shim preservation (no `timeout(source, 5000)` raw-number form).
- Throw at construction if first opts emit is missing required fields.
- Symmetric companion naming `<primitive>State` (existing `rateLimitState` renames to `rateLimiterState`).
- **Reject mode change** — throw on the opts Node when a mode-axis transition is attempted. Document `switchMap`-rebuild as the recipe.
- Land **before Phase 14** so DS-14 has concrete companion-Node shapes to design deltas against.

**Central enum reuse:**
- `StatusValue = "pending" | "active" | "completed" | "errored"` (already exists from `withStatus`) — reused as literal vocabulary inside discriminated state for **lifecycle-shaped primitives** (`timeout`, `retry`).
- `GateState = "open" | "closed"` (NEW central enum) — literal vocabulary inside discriminated state for **gate-shaped primitives** (`budgetGate`, `rateLimiter` extends with `"throttled"`, `circuitBreaker` extends with `"half-open"`).
- The central enum is the literal vocabulary; each primitive's `<Primitive>State` is a discriminated union composing the literal + per-status payload.

**Implementation order:**
1. **`timeout`** (canary — single axis, no mode question) — sub-locked below
2. `budgetGate` (single rebind axis: constraint set; already has reactive `meta` from Tier 3.3)
3. `retry` (two rebind axes: count + backoff; footgun: count shrink below current attempt)
4. `circuitBreaker` / `withBreaker` (three rebind axes; state preservation interesting)
5. `rateLimiter` (most complex; mode axis rejected; B3 (d) reactive gate falls out as the "wait for first opts emit" pattern under widening)

**`timeout` primitive — full sub-lock:**

```ts
import type { StatusValue } from "../resilience/status.js";

export type TimeoutOptions = {
  ns: number;
  meta?: Record<string, unknown>;
};

export type TimeoutState =
  | { status: "pending" }                                                   // no active timer
  | { status: "active"; startedAt_ns: number; deadline_ns: number }          // timer running
  | { status: "completed"; settledAt_ns: number }                            // source resolved before deadline
  | { status: "errored"; firedAt_ns: number; deadline_ns: number };          // timer fired

export type TimeoutBundle<T> = {
  node: Node<T>;
  timeoutState: Node<TimeoutState>;
};

export function timeout<T>(
  source: Node<T>,
  opts: Partial<TimeoutOptions> | Node<Partial<TimeoutOptions>>,
  extraOpts?: ExtraOpts,
): TimeoutBundle<T>;
```

Per-axis policy:
| Axis | Policy | In-flight reconciliation |
|---|---|---|
| `ns` change | Rebind | In-flight deadline NOT changed; new `ns` applies to next attempt only |
| `meta` change | Rebind | Updates immediately; merged onto next attempt's emitted node meta |
| Empty `{}` emit | No-op | Treated as "nothing changed"; no rebind, no companion fire |

Construction-time validation: throw if first opts settle missing/non-positive `ns`. `Node<Partial<TimeoutOptions>>` with `cache === undefined` pauses source until first valid opts emit (same gate pattern as B3 (d) for rateLimiter / B5 reactive-restore for processManager).

Companion semantics: `timeoutState` is snapshot-shaped; default `Object.is`-on-status-field equals. Subscribers don't re-fire on identical-shape transitions but DO fire on every state transition AND on payload changes within the same status. **`timeoutState` covers the `lastTimeout`-style use case** via `status === "errored"` payload (carrying `firedAt_ns` + `deadline_ns`). No separate event-shaped companion.

Test cells: see "D2 — Tier 5.2 reactive-options widening" in earlier post-Phase-13 triage; ~6–10 cells for timeout, ~40–60 across all 5 primitives.

**Pipeline forwarding contract:**
- `resilientPipeline` checks `opts.<primitive>` shape; if static `Partial<Options>`, builds today's static path; if Node-form, **forwards directly without switchMap rebuild**. The switchMap rebuild remains for any non-yet-widened primitives.
- Companion `<primitive>State` lifted onto the pipeline bundle when caller passes Node-form.
- Pipeline's switchMap path skips widened primitives.

**Per-primitive policy tables (locked 2026-05-01):**

**Cross-cutting locks:**
- (α) State preservation across rebind: pre-1.0 break for `retry`, `circuitBreaker`, `rateLimiter` — current "reset on opts swap" semantics goes away. Mode-axis transitions throw on the opts Node.
- `StatusValue` shipped vocabulary `"pending" | "running" | "completed" | "errored"` reused as literal where lifecycle-shaped; widened to add `"cancelled" | "paused"` per follow-on lock above.
- `GateState = "open" | "closed"` ships at `src/extra/resilience/gate-state.ts`. `rateLimiter` extends with `"throttled"`; `circuitBreaker` extends with `"half-open"`. Each primitive's `<Primitive>State` is a discriminated union composing the literal + per-status payload.

**budgetGate** ([src/extra/resilience/budget-gate.ts](../src/extra/resilience/budget-gate.ts))

| Axis | Policy |
|---|---|
| `constraints` array shape | **Reject** — switchMap rebuild recipe |
| Individual constraint values | Reactive per-constraint Node (already shipped) |
| `meta` | Reactive |
| Empty `{}` | No-op |

State preserved: pending buffer, pause flag. Bundle: `BudgetGateBundle<T> = { node: Node<T>; budgetGateState: Node<BudgetGateState> }` where `BudgetGateState = { status: "open" | "closed"; constraintsSnapshot: ReadonlyArray<{ name; satisfied; value }> }`.

**retry** ([src/extra/resilience/retry.ts](../src/extra/resilience/retry.ts))

| Axis | Policy |
|---|---|
| `count` | Rebind, state-preserving. Footgun: new count < current attempt → next failure terminates immediately (document) |
| `backoff` strategy | Rebind, state-preserving. Applies to next delay calc; in-flight delay unchanged |
| `meta` | Reactive |
| Empty `{}` | No-op |

State preserved: `attempt`, `prevDelay`, in-flight timer. Bundle: `RetryBundle<T> = { node: Node<T>; retryState: Node<RetryState> }` where `RetryState = { status: StatusValue; attempt: number; lastDelay_ns: number | null }`. **Pre-1.0 break:** today's reset on opts swap goes away.

**circuitBreaker / withBreaker** ([src/extra/resilience/breaker.ts](../src/extra/resilience/breaker.ts))

| Axis | Policy |
|---|---|
| `failureThreshold` | Rebind, state-preserving. Edge: new threshold ≤ current `_failureCount` → opens on next failure |
| `cooldownNs` / `cooldown` | Rebind, state-preserving. Applies to next open-cycle |
| `halfOpenMax` | Rebind, state-preserving. Applies to next half-open transition |
| `meta` | Reactive (add) |
| `now` | **Reject** — clock override structural |
| Empty `{}` | No-op |

State preserved: `_state`, `_failureCount`, `_openCycle`, `_lastOpenedAt`, `_lastCooldownNs`, `_halfOpenAttempts`. Bundle: existing `breakerState` widens to `Node<BreakerState>` where `BreakerState = { status: GateState ∪ "half-open"; failureCount; openCycle; lastOpenedAtNs; halfOpenAttempts; lastCooldownNs }`. **Pre-1.0 break:** today's reset on opts swap goes away.

**rateLimiter** ([src/extra/resilience/rate-limiter.ts](../src/extra/resilience/rate-limiter.ts))

| Axis | Policy |
|---|---|
| `maxEvents` | Rebind, state-preserving. Cap shrink drops oldest pending excess (existing F-C behavior) |
| `windowNs` | Rebind, state-preserving |
| `maxBuffer` | **Reject** — mode-locked at construction |
| `onOverflow` | Rebind, state-preserving (applies to subsequent events) |
| `meta` | Reactive |
| Empty `{}` | No-op |

State preserved: `bucket`, `pending`, `dropped`, `paused`, `lastState`. Bundle existing: `{ node, droppedCount, rateLimitState }`. `RateLimiterState` widens to discriminated union over `GateState ∪ "throttled"`.

**Pipeline forwarding** ([src/extra/resilience/resilient-pipeline.ts](../src/extra/resilience/resilient-pipeline.ts:236)): switchMap rebuild path stays per primitive; if `opts.<primitive>` is Node-form, forward directly to widened primitive (no switchMap). Companion `<primitive>State` lifted onto pipeline bundle when caller passes Node-form.

**Implementation order:** timeout (already sub-locked) → budgetGate → retry → circuitBreaker → rateLimiter.

#### DS-13.5.C — MemoryRetrievalGraph keepalive + state plumbing — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A); ✅ landed 2026-05-03 (TS; PY-parity deferred)

**Reframe (post-walk 2026-05-01):** original DS-scope text predated C1 rework. Reality:
- No imperative `retrieve()` API exists (already removed pre-walk).
- Shared `this.retrieval` / `this.retrievalTrace` state already dropped (C1 rework).
- Per-call subgraph already mounted at `retrieve_${id}` with named `context`/`result`/`projection`.
- **Real remaining issues:** (i) keepalive leak — per-call subgraph never calls `keepalive()`; (ii) raw `node()` skips `equals` plumbing on `context`/`result`; (iii) `_contextNode` raw + unregistered when `opts.context` not supplied.

**Files:** [src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:553–855](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:553) (`MemoryRetrievalGraph extends Graph`). Cluster M4/EC3/EC4/EC12/EC13/EC14 entries marked addressed by this lock.

**Locked decisions (alt A — per-call subgraph + keepalive-on-projection-TEARDOWN):**
- Per-call subgraph stays mounted at `retrieve_${id}` (no rename, no caller-shared memoization).
- `localContext` and `result` migrate to `sub.state(...)` (Graph's equals plumbing).
- `projection` keeps custom `packedEquals` but uses `sub.derived(...)`.
- Synthesized `_contextNode` (when `opts.context` not supplied) registers on parent `this` graph as `_context` (visible to describe).
- After `this.mount(segment, sub)`, register a TEARDOWN-on-projection disposer that calls `this.remove(segment)` to auto-unmount on last unsubscribe.
- No surface API change. JSDoc on `retrieveReactive` documents the lifecycle contract.
- C1 isolation invariant preserved.

**Hidden invariants (watch-outs):**
- Caller must subscribe to projection OR drop `r` and let TEARDOWN cascade unmount the subgraph.
- Per-call subgraph removal must happen after caller drops; only safe trigger is projection's TEARDOWN cascade.

**Implementation guidance:** if `onLastUnsubscribe(node, fn)` helper isn't already shipped, inline `sub.addDisposer(...)` with manual COMPLETE listener.

**Generalization candidate:** `perCallSubgraph(parent, prefix, factory)` helper extraction deferred — extract after DS-13.5.D.4 (per-claim eval mounting) lands the same shape.

---

#### DS-13.5.D — JobFlow concurrency bounds — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (revised: drop boundedCounter); D.3 + D.4 ✅ landed 2026-05-03 (TS; PY-parity deferred); D.2 deferred (no consumer signal)

*Trigger: `maxPerPump` caps per-tick claims, not concurrent inflight. Reingest is imperative (audit-trail-only edge). `trackingKey` collisions silently overwrite. Per-claim eval subgraphs vanish from describe.*

**D.1 — `maxInflight` per-stage cap ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED** — Tier 6.5 3.1, [src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:533](../src/patterns/job-queue/index.ts:533) + test [src/__tests__/patterns/messaging.test.ts:281](../src/__tests__/patterns/messaging.test.ts:281). Archived.

**D.2 — Reactive bounded-counter primitive — REVISED 2026-05-01: KEEP `tryIncrementBounded`, NO NEW PRIMITIVE.** User direction surfaced the "wrap-imperative-as-reactive-then-bolt-imperative-back" anti-pattern (now codified as COMPOSITION-GUIDE-PATTERNS L2 §44). Original `boundedCounter` proposal would have wrapped existing helper into a bundle whose contents (count Node already exists, `isAtCap` is a one-line derived, `tryIncrement` IS the existing function, reset is one line) add zero new semantics. Decision: **keep `tryIncrementBounded` at [src/extra/mutation/index.ts:58](../src/extra/mutation/index.ts:58)**. **Optional widening (deferred until consumer surfaces):** widen `cap` parameter from `number` to `number | Node<number>` (one-line branch reading `.cache` if Node-shaped) to support reactive caps without wrapping. Reingest-topology declared-deps rewrite parked indefinitely — no consumer signal, harness works imperatively today, Phase 14 doesn't depend on it.

**D.3 — `routeJobIds` collision contract — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A: JSDoc + regression test)**
- File: [src/patterns/harness/types.ts:79–87](../src/patterns/harness/types.ts:79) (`IntakeItem.relatedTo` field).
- Document the contract on `relatedTo`: items lacking `relatedTo[0]` and producing colliding `trackingKey`s overwrite the prior entry; retry/reingest items must set `relatedTo[0]` to the original key.
- No code change. Add a regression-pinning test asserting last-write-wins behavior for the documented contract.
- **Hidden invariant:** ack runs before reingest publishes (harness flow invariant — preserved).

**D.4 — Per-claim eval-verifier subgraph mounting — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A: mount at `eval/${claimId}`)**
- File: [src/patterns/harness/eval-verifier.ts:200–240](../src/patterns/harness/eval-verifier.ts:200).
- Mount per-claim eval subgraph at `eval/${claimId}` on the JobFlow's graph. Cleanup on claim ack/nack.
- Same per-call-subgraph-with-cleanup shape as DS-13.5.C alternative A (candidate for shared `perCallSubgraph` helper extraction once both land).
- **Hidden invariants:** subgraph torn down on claim ack/nack; claimId unique per pump cycle.
- After fix: `describe()` shows `eval/<claimId>::{candidates, dataset, scoresNode, raw, filter}` while claim is active; cleared after ack/nack.

**Why now:** harness is the centerpiece of Wave 1; getting concurrency right pre-Phase-15 evals is high-value.

#### DS-13.5.E — Messaging audit-record schemas — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A: 4 records); ✅ landed 2026-05-03 (TS; PY-parity deferred)

**E.1 — `process/start` + `process/cancel` `wrapMutation` migration ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED** — γ-7-A (2026-04-28), full body wrapped at [src/patterns/process/index.ts:1043](../src/patterns/process/index.ts:1043). B4/D2 fold (sync `persistStateThrowing` inside action body) shipped 2026-05-01. Synthetic-event-emit-error swallow at [process/index.ts:785](../src/patterns/process/index.ts:785) and :870 retained — separate concern (CQRS side-effect events from step handlers). `startStrict()` proposal **DROPPED** (no consumer signal). Archived.

**E.2 — Messaging audit-record schemas — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A: per-site, 4 records)**

Ship 4 record types + matching `keyOf` exports at new file `src/patterns/messaging/audit-records.ts`. `audit` field stays **optional** at all mutation sites (caller opts in). Per-site discriminator via `kind` field; matches `ProcessInstance` precedent. `HubAddTopicRecord` deferred until Hub.addTopic surfaces an audit consumer (no current callsite).

```ts
export interface TopicPublishRecord extends BaseAuditRecord {
  kind: "topic.publish";
  topicName: string;
  itemKey: string;  // result of topic.keyOf(item)
}
export interface SubscriptionAckRecord extends BaseAuditRecord {
  kind: "subscription.ack";
  subscriptionId: string;
  cursor: number;
}
export interface SubscriptionPullAndAckRecord extends BaseAuditRecord {
  kind: "subscription.pullAndAck";
  subscriptionId: string;
  cursor: number;
  itemCount: number;
}
export interface HubRemoveTopicRecord extends BaseAuditRecord {
  kind: "hub.removeTopic";
  topicName: string;
}
```

Plus matching `topicPublishKeyOf`, `subscriptionAckKeyOf`, `subscriptionPullAndAckKeyOf`, `hubRemoveTopicKeyOf` exports.

**Hidden invariants:**
- `kind` strings are pre-1.0 stable contract once shipped (renaming downstream breaks auditors).
- `seq` (from `BaseAuditRecord`) monotonic per audit log; `keyOf` returns stable per-record identifier.

**Why now:** if start/cancel mutation atomicity changes, Phase 14 op-log changesets need to know whether mutation frames are atomic envelopes (E.1 confirms they are).

---

#### DS-13.5.F — `retention.score` side-effect extraction — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A); ✅ landed 2026-05-03 (TS; PY-parity deferred)

**Reframe (post-walk 2026-05-01):** original DS scope mostly addressed by Tier 4.3 B (closure-state promotion shipped 2026-04-29). Remaining: D1 fix only.

**F.1 — Closure-state promotion ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED** — Tier 4.3 B (2026-04-29). `permanentKeys` is now `reactiveMap<string, true>` mounted at [memory-composers.ts:319](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:319); `entryCreatedAtNs` is `reactiveMap<string, number>` mounted at [memory-composers.ts:321](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:321). Both visible to `describe()` / `explain()`.

**F.2 — `tierClassifier` feedback-cycle retirement ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED** — retention wired into distill at construction time (line 383: `mapOptions: { retention }`). Archival happens synchronously inside distill's mutation, not as secondary reactive effect. Zero §7 feedback cycle.

**F.3 — D1 fix (`retention.score` side-effect extraction) — LOCKED 2026-05-01 (alt A)**
- File: [src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:355–367](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:355) (`retention.score` body) + [line 363](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:363) (the offending `entryCreatedAtNsRef.set(...)` first-write).
- Extract first-write into a new effect mounted on the parent graph at `entryCreatedAtNs/sync`. Effect watches `store.entries`; on each new key (not present in `entryCreatedAtNs`), writes `entryCreatedAtNs.set(key, nowNs)`. Idempotent — re-emits skip already-set keys.
- After extraction: `retention.score` becomes pure (read-only against `entryCreatedAtNs.get(key)`).
- Existing `?? nowNs` fallback covers the race window where `score` runs before the effect (no new race introduced).
- **`retention.onArchive` callback unused — leave unused** (POST-1.0 carry; current distill retention path handles archival inside its mutation, no consumer needs the callback).

**Hidden invariants:**
- INVARIANT: effect runs before first archival scan, OR `score` fn handles undefined-timestamp via `?? nowNs` fallback (already the case today).
- INVARIANT: effect is idempotent — re-emissions of `store.entries` for already-tracked keys skip via `entryCreatedAtNs.has(key)` check before write.
- INVARIANT: `entryCreatedAtNs` GC cleanup ([line 427](../src/patterns/ai/memory/memory-composers.ts:427)) still drives via the existing subscriber that compares against active keys.
- Snapshot portability preserved (same keys, same timestamps; only the write path changes).

**Why now:** Phase 14 changesets want clean state-node visibility for delta tracking.

---

#### DS-13.5.G — `extends Graph` consistency sweep ✅ closed without action (2026-05-01)

Audit confirmed Phase 12.D's `extends Graph` migration is complete across all eligible factories: cqrs, messaging (topic/subscription/hub/topicBridge), job-queue (jobQueue/jobFlow), pipeline, AI memory (collection/vectorIndex/knowledgeGraph/agentMemory), refineLoop. `processManager` is a legitimate non-class exception — it returns `ProcessManagerResult` (imperative coordinator with no constructor-time reactive invariants). Zero consumer code uses `instanceof DomainGraph` narrowing.

**Closing audit (2026-05-01):** Explore-agent grep confirmed `class \w+ extends Graph` (17 hits, all eligible factories), `Object.assign(graph` (0 actual factories — both hits are comments documenting prior migration), `instanceof <CapabilityGraph>` (0 consumer sites — only `instanceof Graph` at framework-internal sites: `inspect/audit.ts:511`, `graph/topology-tree.ts:67/90`). No follow-up.

### Phase 13.6 — Rules/invariants audit + library-wide cleanup pass

*Source: lock-down-session insight 2026-05-01 — the DS-13.5 walks surfaced enough cross-cutting inconsistencies (bundle vs Node vs Graph form, imperative-vs-reactive boundary placement, when to wrap as primitive vs widen with `T | Node<T>`) that a dedicated audit-and-cleanup phase is warranted before Phase 14 opens.*

**Placement:** AFTER DS-13.5 implementation completes, BEFORE Phase 14 (changesets/diff). The audit wants concrete code to compare rules against; landed DS-13.5 changes are the natural baseline. The audit may also surface principles that affect Phase 14 design (op-log changesets touch every reactive primitive).

**Phase 13.6.A — Rules/invariants inventory + contradiction check + locking**
- Compile every rule / invariant / principle / anti-pattern from canonical guidance: GRAPHREFLY-SPEC §5.8–5.12, COMPOSITION-GUIDE L0/L1/L2/L3 (4 files), feedback memories. Inventory document seeded by the 2026-05-01 lock-down session (`docs/implementation-plan-13.6-prep-inventory.md`) — see that file for the precursor list.
- Contradiction-check the inventoried rules. Surface overlaps, conflicts, gaps.
- Identify encountered-issues that should generate new rules (anti-patterns observed but not yet codified). The DS-13.5 walks already added L2 §44; expect 3–7 more candidate rules from the audit.
- Lock the "ultimate" invariants document. Output: amendments to spec § + COMPOSITION-GUIDE sections.
- **Substantial 9Q audit; produces a doc, not code.**

**Phase 13.6.B — Library-wide cleanup against locked invariants**
- Per-layer pass: core → extras → patterns → solutions.
- Each layer audited against locked invariants; deviations either fixed or filed as accepted exceptions with rationale.
- Parallelizable across layers; expect 3–6 implementation sub-sessions (one per layer + cross-cutting tidy-ups).
- Output: code changes across `src/`, possibly minor spec/guide tightening as the audit process surfaces ambiguities.

**Phase 13.6.B sub-sessions in flight:**
- ✅ **B1** — config field foundations (Locks 2.A field, 2.F′ fields, 6.A field) + tiny fixes (Lock 6.C′ `partial:true` flip, Lock 6.H verified, Lock 4.C verified). Landed 2026-05-03.
- ✅ **B2** — cleanup hook field rename (Lock 4.A: `beforeRun → onRerun`, `deactivate → onDeactivation`, `invalidate → onInvalidate`; Lock 4.A′ all firing sites updated). Landed 2026-05-03. **Carry:** Lock 4.A drop-`() => void` shorthand call-site sweep (~48 files) deferred — see `docs/optimizations.md`.
- ✅ **B3** — PAUSE buffer reshape (Lock 2.C structural + Lock 2.C′ + Lock 2.C′-pre + Lock 6.A enforcement). `_pauseBuffer: Messages[]`, per-wave replay, tier-3+4 settle slice, `pauseBufferMax` overflow → terminal ERROR. Landed 2026-05-03. **Carry:** Lock 2.C pre-pause cache-snapshot for replay-equals semantics deferred — see `docs/optimizations.md`.
- ✅ **B4 (folded into QA pass on B1+B2+B3, 2026-05-03)** — Lock 2.F′ wired (`MAX_RERUN_DEPTH` and `MAX_DRAIN_ITERATIONS` removed from module level; both reads route through `cfg.maxFnRerunDepth` / `cfg.maxBatchDrainIterations`; diagnostics broadened to carry `{ phase, queueSizeAtThrow, configuredLimit }` and `{ nodeId, currentDepth, configuredLimit, lastDiscoveredDeps? }`).
- ✅ **B5 (folded into QA pass, 2026-05-03)** — Lock 2.A wired (`equalsThrowPolicy` branched in `_updateState`'s equals-throw catch: `"rethrow"` keeps existing abort-walk-then-emit-ERROR semantics; `"log-and-continue"` logs once per node via `console.error` and treats throw as `unchanged === false` to emit DATA verbatim).
- ✅ **B6** — Lock 6.F (Q16 auto-COMPLETE-before-TEARDOWN — already landed in DS-13.5.A) + Lock 6.G `replayBuffer: N` implementation. Landed 2026-05-03. `NodeOptions.replayBuffer?: number` + `NodeImpl._replayBuffer`/`_replayBufferCapacity`; push site at `_emit` dispatch point (NOT inside `_updateState` — avoids RESUME-drain re-push corrupting the "values-seen" semantic); replay site in `defaultOnSubscribe` (buffer authoritative when non-empty; falls back to legacy cache-DATA push); cleared by `_deactivate` (TEARDOWN, last-unsub) and `_resetForFreshLifecycle` (terminal-resubscribable reset); INVALIDATE preserves buffer (history independent of `_cached`). 15 audit-sweep tests in `phase-13-6-b6.test.ts`. Lock 6.H (INVALIDATE → `sentinel`) was already landed via DS-13.5.A. **Carry:** TLC #20 / #23 property-mirror port (`ReplayBufferBounded` / `LateSubscriberReceivesReplay`) deferred — see `docs/optimizations.md` "rigor-infra follow-ons".
- ✅ **B7** — Lock 6.D `ctx.store` default flip (preserve-across-deactivation). Landed 2026-05-03. Removed the wipe sites in `_deactivate` and `_resetForFreshLifecycle`; migrated 13 files where current behavior depended on auto-wipe via per-operator `onDeactivation` cleanup hooks: `extra/operators/take.ts` (take/skip/takeWhile/last), `extra/operators/transform.ts` (scan/reduce/distinctUntilChanged/pairwise), `extra/operators/time.ts` (interval), `extra/sources/async.ts` (toArray), `extra/io/csv.ts` (csvRows), `extra/io/ndjson.ts` (ndjsonRows), `extra/composition/materialize.ts` (selector), `patterns/ai/prompts/frozen-context.ts` (extends existing onInvalidate), `patterns/ai/prompts/streaming.ts` (accumulatedText), `patterns/ai/extractors/cost-meter.ts`, `patterns/ai/extractors/tool-call.ts`, `patterns/ai/extractors/keyword-flag.ts`, `patterns/job-queue/index.ts` (delete `inflight` key in existing hook). 5 audit-sweep tests in `phase-13-6-b7.test.ts`. `core/sugar.ts`'s `__autoTrackLastDiscoveryError` slot is auto-cleared on success — preserve is fine; no migration needed. JSDoc on `FnCtx.store` updated to reflect the flip.
- ✅ **B8** — extras data-structure cleanup. Landed 2026-05-03. Lock 5.A: `reactiveLog<T>` narrowed — `lastValue: Node<T>` (was `Node<T | undefined>`); `hasLatest` companion removed (empty-vs-non-empty disambiguates from wave shape RESOLVED vs DATA); `append`/`appendMany` runtime-guard reject literal `undefined` with diagnostic referencing Lock 5.A. Lock 4.D: `defaultTierOpts` constant exported from `src/extra/storage/tiers.ts` documenting canonical defaults (`debounceMs: 0`, `compactEvery: undefined`, `filter: undefined`, `codec: jsonCodec`, `keyOf: undefined`); per-tier impls already honor these (no behavior change). Lock 6.E: `compactEvery` documented as part of the defaults table — uniform overflow guard already shipped in snapshot/append-log/kv tiers (no behavior change). 6 audit-sweep tests in `phase-13-6-b8.test.ts` + updates to `reactive-log-stress.test.ts`. JSDoc updated on reactiveLog.
- ✅ **B9** — patterns + testing. Landed 2026-05-03; QA pass 2026-05-04 added P1 (`firstWhere` settle helpers gate on `!settled` so kick-throws-after-fired-DATA can't overwrite a resolved Promise) + P2 (`wrapMutation.compensate` gates on `captureSet` so framework-level batch-frame errors before `action()` ran don't fire user compensation) + D1 (new `onResubscribableReset` hook slot fired from `_resetForFreshLifecycle` for the multi-sub-stayed terminal-resubscribable path; migrated `frozenContext`) + D2 (`BudgetGateBundle.dispose` releases `keepalive`/`onExhausted`/abort-fan-out subscriptions + aborts in-flight controllers; idempotent) + D3 (`LLMAdapter.abortCapable?: boolean` capability flag; `withBudgetGate` warns once per construction when the wrapped adapter doesn't declare `abortCapable: true`; SDK adapters anthropic/openai-compat/google/dry-run all declared `true`; `adapterWrapper` propagates the flag through middleware chains) + D5 (`assertDirtyPrecedesTerminalData` extends carve-out to skip the push-on-subscribe handshake window `[START, (DATA|RESOLVED)*, DIRTY?]` so Lock 6.G replay-buffer streams pass cleanly) + D6 (test (i) tightened to assert exact post-RESUME buffer contents `[1, 2, 3]` + new test (i.2) for the post-equals "outgoing" semantic with collapsed values; JSDoc on `replayBuffer` documents the post-equals semantic). Lock 3.A: `firstWhere` (and downstream `awaitSettled`) accepts `kick: () => void` opt — subscribe lands synchronously in the function body (NOT inside the Promise executor) and `kick` fires after; sync settlements during the kick are recorded and replayed when the Promise constructor runs. Replaces the M.20-load-bearing comment pattern with a misuse-impossible API. Lock 3.B: new public testing surface `@graphrefly/graphrefly/testing` with `assertDirtyPrecedesTerminalData(messages)` helper; seeds `src/testing/` directory + `package.json` exports + `tsup.config.ts` ENTRY_POINTS. Lock 3.C: `withBudgetGate` auto-wires adapter abort + dev-mode warning on missing `abortCapable`. Lock 4.B (A): `wrapMutation` accepts `compensate: () => void` opt — fires after batch rollback ONLY when the action body actually threw (P2 gate). Lock 4.B (B) `registerMutable` + (C) dev-mode Proxy detection deferred — see `docs/optimizations.md`. Lock 1.A retest: 5 imperative-controller primitives audited against §44 abort criteria — all pass; no redesigns. Tests: `phase-13-6-b9.test.ts` + `phase-13-6-qa.test.ts` + `__tests__/testing/assertions.test.ts` + extensions to `middleware.test.ts`. Lock 3.A: `firstWhere` (and downstream `awaitSettled`) accepts `kick: () => void` opt — subscribe lands synchronously in the function body (NOT inside the Promise executor) and `kick` fires after; sync settlements during the kick are recorded and replayed when the Promise constructor runs. Replaces the M.20-load-bearing comment pattern with a misuse-impossible API. Lock 3.B: new public testing surface `@graphrefly/graphrefly/testing` with `assertDirtyPrecedesTerminalData(messages)` helper (P.25 carve-out: leading [RESOLVED] allowed without preceding DIRTY); seeds `src/testing/` directory + `package.json` exports + `tsup.config.ts` ENTRY_POINTS. Lock 3.C: `withBudgetGate` auto-wires adapter abort — every invoke/stream creates an `AbortController`, threaded as combined signal with caller's; on isOpen open→closed transition all in-flight controllers are aborted with the budget-exhausted error. Lock 4.B (A): `wrapMutation` accepts `compensate: () => void` opt — fires after batch rollback, before audit failure record; throws inside compensate logged via `console.error` without masking the original action error. Lock 4.B (B) `registerMutable` + (C) dev-mode Proxy detection deferred — see `docs/optimizations.md`. Lock 1.A retest: 5 imperative-controller primitives (`pipeline.gate`, `JobQueueGraph`, `CqrsGraph`, `saga`, `processManager`) audited against §44 abort criteria — all pass (alternative is `producer.emit()` upstream + same internal mutation, hitting "stop the work in vain"); no redesigns. 14 tests across `phase-13-6-b9.test.ts` + `__tests__/testing/assertions.test.ts`.
- ⏳ **B10** — spec/doc edits (`~/src/graphrefly/`) + audit sweeps. **Deferred 2026-05-03 — TS-side audits closed; cross-repo edits filed as carry.** TS-side findings:
  - **Lock 4.E (`latestData → prevData` rename):** zero remaining `latestData` references in `src/` — already complete.
  - **Lock 1.B dead-code sweep (`=== undefined` guards on `data[i]`):** the lock claims first-run gate makes these dead. In practice the 26 `batch0 == null` / `data[i] === undefined` sites in `extra/` are LIVE — they detect "dep was not involved in this wave" per the `FnCtx.data[i]` shape contract (`undefined` = not involved; `[]` = involved + RESOLVED; `[v...]` = DATA). Sweep would be a behavior change. **Re-investigate when the Lock 1.B sweep is sharpened (which exact pattern is dead code).**
  - **Lock 1.C cache-read sweep + 1.E carve-out + 2.B/2.D/4.F/5.B/5.C/5.D consolidations + 7.A process-rule move:** these are documentation edits in `~/src/graphrefly/GRAPHREFLY-SPEC.md` and `COMPOSITION-GUIDE-*.md`. Cross-repo work; deferred to a dedicated spec-edit pass that walks the COMPOSITION-GUIDE files end-to-end. **Filed as a carry in `docs/optimizations.md`.** The lock-document `implementation-plan-13.6-locks-draft.md` enumerates the exact edit targets per lock.
  - **Tier 9.1 inspectGraph + processManager carry-throughs (10.9 in plan):** unchanged by 13.6.B; remains tracked there.

**Why now:** the DS-13.5 walks repeatedly hit "is this principle codified anywhere?" — for the cases we hit (e.g., §44 `T | Node<T>` widening), the answer was "no, lock-down session was the first time." Implies more such gaps. A dedicated audit phase before Phase 14 sets the substrate cleanly.

**Rust-port deferral classification (guardrail for 13.6.B scope)**

*Source: 2026-05-02 brainstorm on Rust-port timing. Phase 13.6.A spec/lock work is language-independent — both the current TS impl and any future Rust port must honor identical invariants. Phase 13.6.B implementation work, however, has dramatically asymmetric cost in TS vs Rust for some items. Mark the carve-outs explicitly so 13.6.B doesn't bolt heavy hardening onto TS that would be near-free in Rust.*

**DON'T DEFER — do in TS during 13.6.A + 13.6.B:**
- All of 13.6.A — invariant lock, contradiction check, doc amendments. Pure spec/doc work, language-irrelevant.
- Spec-level rollback semantics (L2.35-rollback-*) — contract every impl must honor.
- Audit-record schemas (DS-13.5.E) — wire format, both impls must agree.
- Imperative-vs-reactive boundary rubric (DS-13.5.G follow-up) — API design.
- Reactive composition primitives — domain semantics belong in spec / COMPOSITION-GUIDE regardless of impl language.

**STRONG DEFER — leave for Rust port; don't bolt onto TS:**
- Hardening rollback against the L2.35-rollback-scope caveat ("closure mutations not covered"). In Rust, `&mut T` ownership + `imbl`-style persistent collections make this nearly automatic. Catch-mutation gymnastics in TS would be fighting the language for a temporary fix.
- ACID storage-tier tightening (G.27-atomicity beyond best-effort). `redb`-style ACID transactions are a Rust crate choice; in TS this is a multi-week project.
- Strict per-tier transaction semantics in storage primitives — same reason as above.

### Phase 13.7 — Rust M1 bench feasibility study

*Source: 2026-05-03 dev-dispatch on Rust-port timing. With 13.6.A locked (canonical spec + 24 invariant locks), the M1 (`graphrefly-core`) port has a stable target for the dispatcher subset. DS-14 (changesets) and the disconnect/resubscribe DS are still open, but neither lands in M1 territory — DS-14 is M5/M2/M4 (structures + graph snapshot + storage WAL) and the rewire DS is graph-layer (per R3.3.1: edges are derived from construction-time `_deps`, no `connect`/`disconnect` API). This phase lets us produce real Rust-vs-TS bench data BEFORE committing to full M1, and feed that data INTO the DS-14 design.*

**Placement:** AFTER Phase 13.6.A locks (✅ done 2026-05-03), BEFORE DS-14. Runs in parallel with Phase 13.6.B and the disconnect/resubscribe DS — they don't conflict.

**Framing:** This is a **bench feasibility study**, not the production M1 commit. The output is data + a re-decision gate, not a published `@graphrefly/core-rs` package.

**Scope — port only the 13.6-locked dispatcher subset to `graphrefly-rs/crates/graphrefly-core/`:**
- `message` — message tuples, tier definitions, interned constants
- `handle` — `NodeId(u64)`, `HandleId(u64)`, `FnId(u64)` newtypes
- `clock` — `monotonic_ns` / `wall_clock_ns` (`std::time::Instant` + `SystemTime`)
- `boundary` — `BindingBoundary` trait mirroring TS prototype
- `node` — dispatcher, dep tracking, first-run gate, equals-substitution
- `batch` — wave coalescing, two-phase deferred delivery
- PAUSE/RESUME with lockId set (R2.6)
- INVALIDATE broadcast
- TEARDOWN auto-precedes COMPLETE (Lock 6.F / R2.6.4)
- Meta TEARDOWN ordering (R1.3.9.d) — load-bearing
- Minimal V0/V1 versioning (NO DS-14 op-log counter shape)

**Reference impl:** [src/__experiments__/handle-core/](../src/__experiments__/handle-core/) — 22 prototype tests, validated cleaving plane.

**Acceptance bar:**
- All 22 prototype tests green ([core.test.ts](../src/__experiments__/handle-core/core.test.ts) + [extensions.test.ts](../src/__experiments__/handle-core/extensions.test.ts)).
- Property-test fixtures from `src/__tests__/properties/_invariants.ts` ported to `proptest` and green.
- TLC harness in CI runs the full envelope of 13.6-locked semantics:
  - `wave_protocol_MC` (base diamond) — already verified clean
  - `wave_protocol_pause_MC` — multi-pauser correctness
  - `wave_protocol_custom_equals_MC` — equals-substitution variance
  - `wave_protocol_multisink_MC` / `_batch_MC` — multi-sink iteration
  - `wave_protocol_invalidate_MC` / `_diamond_MC` — INVALIDATE cleanup
  - `wave_protocol_resubscribe_MC` — pause-lock leak across resubscribe (`ResubscribeYieldsCleanState`)
  - `wave_protocol_replay_resubscribe_MC` — replay-ring × resubscribe cross-axis
  - `wave_protocol_meta_teardown_MC` — meta TEARDOWN cascade pre-reset witness
  - All 5 handle-protocol scenario MCs from [docs/research/](docs/research/) — handle-interpretation refinement (already verified, 39,331 distinct states)
- `cargo deny check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets`, `cargo fmt --check` clean.

**Bench plan** — the value the study produces:
1. **Microbench (no FFI):** dispatcher hot path on identity-equals-substituted DATA. Goal: floor on dispatcher cost without binding overhead.
2. **Microbench (with napi-rs FFI):** cost per `invokeFn` boundary crossing from Node. Goal: realistic per-fn-fire cost.
3. **Macrobench:** large diamond (100-fanout), deep chains, batch coalescing under load. Compare wall-time + alloc count against current TS core via vitest bench harness.
4. **Cross-Worker bench:** shared `Arc<RwLock<T>>` core driven from N Node Workers. Goal: validate the uniquely-Rust-side win claim from the rust-port session doc.
5. **Equals-substitution profile:** verify identity-equals path is u64 compare with zero FFI; custom-equals path crosses boundary exactly once per check (FFI counter assertion).

**Disconnect/resubscribe pre-decision (de-risk M1 against the open DS):**
- M1 Rust core stores DepRecords keyed by `NodeId` (not by index) — already the natural Rust shape, mirrors TS prototype. This way, future rewire (if it lands as a Graph-layer "remove + re-add with cache preservation" API) doesn't require core dispatcher rework.
- M1 keeps `_deps` immutable post-construction (mirrors R3.3.1 "edges derived from construction-time deps"). No premature `set_deps()` primitive.
- All 13.6-locked resubscribe semantics (R2.2.7 ROM/RAM, R2.4.6 `ctx.store` lifecycle, R2.5.3 `_hasCalledFnOnce` reset, R2.6.4 TEARDOWN auto-precedes COMPLETE) are in-scope and acceptance-tested via the resubscribe TLC MCs above.

**Re-decision gate (post-bench):**
After bench data lands, **pause** before extending to M2/M3/M4/M5. Decision options:
- (a) Continue to M2 if bench data justifies the migration cost AND DS-14 has locked.
- (b) Pause until DS-14 locks, even if M1 bench data is favorable.
- (c) Throw away the bench impl if data is unfavorable; iterate on TS core instead.

Default: (b) — DS-14 locks before any further Rust work.

**STRONG DEFER — explicitly NOT in this phase:**
- M2 (`graphrefly-graph`) — depends on DS-14 `restoreSnapshot mode: "diff"`.
- M3 (`graphrefly-operators`) — wait until M1 bench data confirms FFI overhead is acceptable for hot-path operators.
- M4 (`graphrefly-storage`) — depends on DS-14 WAL replay shape + 13.6.B-deferred ACID work.
- M5 (`graphrefly-structures`) — STRONG DEFER per Phase 14 guardrail. Depends entirely on DS-14 op-log protocol.
- Production `@graphrefly/*-rs` package publication — not until full M1 closes post-DS-14.
- Replacing TS core in main package — bench study is parallel, not substitution.

**Tracker:** `~/src/graphrefly-rs/docs/migration-status.md` — update bench-study sub-status alongside the existing milestone table.

### Phase 13.8 — TS rewire exploratory impl + integration gap-finding

*Source: 2026-05-04 dev-dispatch follow-up after Phase 13.7 v0 bench landed. The disconnect/resubscribe DS produced a TLA+-verified `node.setDeps` substrate primitive (`docs/research/wave_protocol_rewire.tla`, 35,950 distinct states clean) and 9 integration tests in the M1 Rust core (`~/src/graphrefly-rs/crates/graphrefly-core/tests/setdeps.rs`). The Rust impl validates the **substrate** semantics; it cannot exercise interactions with the **full graphrefly feature set** (PAUSE/RESUME, INVALIDATE, TEARDOWN, replay buffer, meta companions, batch coalescing, COMPLETE/ERROR cascade) because those are M1 parity work deferred behind DS-14.*

**Placement:** runs in parallel with Phase 13.7's re-decision pause; lands BEFORE DS-14 design opens. Gap-finding here directly informs DS-14 (changesets/diff touches every reactive primitive — rewire interactions are part of that surface).

**Framing:** this is an **exploratory implementation**, not a production landing. The goal is to surface gaps the design walks couldn't pre-imagine — implementing `setDeps` against the full TS dispatcher will expose real interaction issues that pure thinking missed. Output is a gap-finding doc + design-notes amendments, NOT a public API export.

**Scope — implement minimally in TS, behind feature flags:**

1. **`node.setDeps(newDeps)`** in `src/core/node.ts` — substrate primitive mirroring the Rust impl. Self-rewire + cycle rejection enforced at this layer per [docs/research/rewire-design-notes.md](docs/research/rewire-design-notes.md).
2. **`graph.rewire(name, newDeps)`** in `src/graph/graph.ts` — Graph-layer wrapper. Mount-aware path resolution (deps may be `mount::leaf`-style); audit record emission via existing `GraphRewireAudit` shape (mirror `GraphRemoveAudit` from R3.2.3).
3. **Internal-only API.** Do NOT add to public exports until DS-14 lock allows it. Use `__rewire` / `__setDeps` naming to signal experimental status.

**Integration test scenarios — one per gap the Rust impl can't cover:**

| # | Scenario | Question to answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | rewire mid-`batch()` | Does an in-flight batch see consistent topology, or do mid-batch rewires get interleaved? |
| 2 | rewire × INVALIDATE same wave | INVALIDATE clears cache; rewire preserves cache. What's the end state? |
| 3 | rewire while paused | Locks preserved per design. Pauser holds L; can RESUME(L) still work after rewire? What if the pauser was on a removed dep? |
| 4 | rewire × TEARDOWN cascade | TEARDOWN auto-precedes COMPLETE (R2.6.4). Rewire-during-teardown undefined; spec call needed. |
| 5 | rewire × non-empty replay buffer | Resolved analytically (preserve N's replay; discard removed dep's DepRecord). Verify with non-empty buffer at rewire time. |
| 6 | rewire × meta companions | Meta TEARDOWN ordering (R1.3.9.d) is load-bearing. Adding/removing meta companions via rewire? |
| 7 | rewire × dep COMPLETE/ERROR | Auto-cascade gating (Lock 2.B). Removed dep was the COMPLETE/ERROR source — does cascade still fire? |
| 8 | rewire × resubscribable terminal-reset in flight | `resubscribable: true` node post-COMPLETE clears `_hasCalledFnOnce` + DepRecords. Rewire in same wave? |
| 9 | rewire × cross-mount path | `graph.rewire("mount::leaf", [...])` — does mount unmount/remount affect rewire? |

**Real-consumer use case:**

Build a **mock AI self-pruning harness** scenario (per [project_rewire_gap memory](../#)). The harness:
- Constructs a multi-stage pipeline (e.g. `ingest → enrich → score → output`).
- At runtime, identifies a redundant wrapper node (`enrich` is no-op for some inputs).
- Calls `graph.rewire("score", ["ingest"])` to bypass the wrapper.
- Asserts: cache preserved, downstream consumers see correct values, no interruption.

If this can't be expressed cleanly with the proposed API, the rewire shape is wrong. Output: design questions for DS-14 input.

**Output deliverables:**

1. `src/core/node.ts` — `__setDeps()` impl (~100 lines).
2. `src/graph/graph.ts` — `__rewire()` wrapper (~50 lines).
3. `src/__tests__/rewire-integration.test.ts` — 9 scenarios from table above.
4. `src/__tests__/rewire-mock-harness.test.ts` — AI self-pruning use case.
5. `docs/research/rewire-gap-findings.md` — gap-finding doc:
   - For each scenario: did it work cleanly / break / require design change?
   - Surfaced design questions for DS-14 / Rust M1 setDeps.
   - Recommendations for canonical-spec amendments (R3.3.1 currently says "no `connect`/`disconnect`" — does it need a `setDeps` clause?).
6. Updated [docs/research/rewire-design-notes.md](docs/research/rewire-design-notes.md) — append "TS impl findings" section with resolved-from-implementation decisions.

**Non-goals (explicit):**

- Do NOT add `setDeps`/`rewire` to public exports. Internal/experimental only.
- Do NOT optimize for perf. Correctness probe; can be O(N²) walk if it makes the impl clearer.
- Do NOT add the M1 parity features in Rust (PAUSE/RESUME, INVALIDATE, etc.) — those are gated on DS-14 per Phase 13.7 re-decision.
- Do NOT wire into `harnessLoop` or any production patterns — just unit tests + mock scenarios.

**Why now (vs. wait for M1 Rust setDeps to land full parity):**

- Pass 3+6 bench data justifies the Rust port; Rust setDeps WILL land eventually with full parity. But the integration-gap findings inform DS-14 design TODAY, not 2-3 months from now when M1 closes.
- The Rust impl is throwaway-ish for these gap categories anyway (different language idioms, GC pressure, message protocol shape) — TS impl is the right surface to find graphrefly-specific issues.
- AI self-pruning use case has been blocked since 2026-04-26 ([project_rewire_gap memory](../#)). This unblocks consumer experimentation.

**Re-decision gate:**

After gap-finding doc lands, surface decisions to user:
- Should canonical-spec be amended (R3.3.1 update; new R rule for `setDeps`)?
- Should Rust M1 setDeps semantics be modified based on findings?
- Are there scenarios that require DS-14 to change shape?

Default: pause again, integrate findings into DS-14 design when it opens.

### Phase 14 — Post-1.0 changesets / diff (single unified design session)

*Source: optimizations.md "Store-mutation-events protocol (deferred post-1.0...)"*

Pre-1.0 placement justified by user re-prio: lands AFTER Phase 13 multi-agent ships so the agent-layer ergonomics don't get rewritten under us, and BEFORE Phase 15 evals so eval-side reactivity benefits from the new delta protocol.

**DESIGN-SESSION-NEEDED (DS-14):** substantial 9Q audit. Co-design five threads in one session because they share the version-counter substrate (Wave 4 `*Backend.version: number` already shipped):

1. **Op-log changeset protocol** — `reactiveMap` / `reactiveList` / `reactiveLog` / `reactiveIndex` emit `{ version, ops, rootRef? }` instead of full snapshots.
2. **Worker bridge wire-protocol Option B** — drop `lastSent` closure diffing; emit full snapshots on real changes only via `equals`-based RESOLVED suppression.
3. **`lens.flow` delta companion** — `Node<FlowDelta>` peer of `.entries`; O(1) per event regardless of subscriber count.
4. **`reactiveLog.scan(initial, step)` incremental-reduce operator** — O(1) per append for `withBudgetGate`-style aggregates.
5. **`restoreSnapshot mode: "diff"` WAL replay** — depends on (1)+(2)+the `StorageTier.listByPrefix(prefix)` / `readWAL(key)` extension.

Co-design rationale: all five rest on a delta protocol with `version` field = the per-substrate counter. Designing in isolation produces incompatible deltas. Landing across 2–3 implementation sessions afterward.

**Rust-port deferral classification (guardrail for Phase 14 land scope)**

*Source: 2026-05-02 brainstorm on Rust-port timing. The user-facing API shape of the delta protocol must be designed and shipped in TS first — both to validate the surface and to give 1.0 a complete story. But the perf-and-rigor hardening of the same surface lands much more cheaply on a Rust substrate. Mark the carve-outs.*

**DON'T DEFER — do in TS during Phase 14 land:**
- Op-log changeset protocol shape (`{ version, ops, rootRef? }`) — user-facing API, must validate in TS.
- Delta protocol `version` field semantics — both impls share.
- `lens.flow` delta companion API shape — public surface.
- `restoreSnapshot mode: "diff"` user contract — semantics, not perf.
- All five DS-14 threads' API shapes — the *surface*, not the substrate.
- Codec envelope evolution for delta-aware codecs (`DagCborCodec` integration with version-counter substrate).

**STRONG DEFER — leave for Rust port; don't bolt onto TS:**
- High-throughput diff/changeset replay performance. Rust `imbl`-style persistent collections give O(log n) snapshot-and-revert naturally; TS impl gets correctness, Rust impl gets perf-without-engineering.
- Strict cross-tier WAL atomicity beyond best-effort (depends on storage-tier ACID work that's also Rust-deferred per Phase 13.6 guardrail).
- CRDT-backed `reactiveMap` / `reactiveLog` variants. The Rust CRDT ecosystem (`yrs`, `automerge`, `loro`, `diamond-types`) dominates — yjs JS users increasingly run yrs under WASM. Doing CRDT work in TS first means re-implementing or wasm-wrapping work that gets redone on the port.
- `peerGraph(transport)` multi-replica sync (already POST-1.0 per Phase 8.5; flagging here so it doesn't get pulled into pre-1.0 by accident — Rust + libp2p + IPLD content-addressing gives this natively).
- Cross-replica changeset merging with CRDT semantics — same Rust ecosystem alignment.

### Phase 14.5 — Roadmap residuals (between changesets and eval)

*Source: `docs/roadmap.md` items not otherwise covered by Phases 11–14 or 16. Pulled into the canonical plan 2026-04-30 so consumers do not need to cross-reference roadmap.md.*

This phase captures roadmap items that didn't fit elsewhere in the new sequencing. Most are post-Phase-13 follow-ons (multi-agent unblocks them) or pre-launch polish (lands inline with Phase 16 prep). A few are Phase 11 carries that were already triaged — listed here for cross-reference only.

#### 14.5.1 §9.8 `refineLoop` tail
*Source: roadmap.md §9.8 "Reactive optimization loop"; v1 shipped 2026-04-22, follow-ons deferred*
- **NOW-eligible (Phase 13 follow-on):** `refineExecutor(refineLoopFactory, opts?)` — adapter that plugs `refineLoop` into the EXECUTE slot of `harnessLoop`. Composition E from §9.0. v1 unblocked the surface; the Phase 13 multi-agent layer is the natural caller (refining a sub-agent's prompt within an outer harness loop). Land when a real consumer surfaces.
- **POST-1.0:** `mutateAndRefine(teacher, styles?, opts?)` — built-in strategy variant.
- **POST-1.0:** `strategyRegistry(entries)` + `autoSelectStrategy(registry, context)` — BMAD-inspired registry for strategy selection.
- **TIES TO PHASE 15:** `optimizeCatalog(catalog, dataset, opts?)` — wraps `refineLoop` for catalog description optimization. Co-land with Phase 15 catalog automation (§9.1b in roadmap).
- **Phase 16 deliverables:** Blog "The feedback loop is the product"; comparison page "GraphReFly refineLoop vs DSPy vs agent-opt".

#### 14.5.2 `toolInterceptor(agentLoop, opts?)` sugar
*Source: roadmap.md §9.0 Composition C "Agent tool interception"; previously blocked on agentLoop reactive refactor*
- **NOW-eligible (Phase 13 follow-on):** the `interceptToolCalls` splice shipped 2026-04-22 (`agentLoop.interceptToolCalls?: (calls: Node<readonly ToolCall[]>) => Node<readonly ToolCall[]>`). `toolInterceptor` becomes thin sugar: a named primitive that builds a valve + budgetGate + gate pipeline and feeds it into `interceptToolCalls`. Land alongside Phase 13.G/H if a real consumer surfaces; otherwise document as a recipe in COMPOSITION-GUIDE-PATTERNS §31.

#### 14.5.3 `mockLLM` promotion to public testing export
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 7.6 "Mock LLM fixture system"*
- **NOW-eligible:** scenario-scripted `mockLLM` exists at `src/__tests__/helpers/mock-llm.ts` with stage detection, call recording, per-stage cycling, and `callsFor(stage)` inspection. Promote to public export at `src/testing/mock-llm.ts` (or `@graphrefly/graphrefly/testing` subpath) so any developer testing AI patterns can use it. **Useful for Phase 13.M worked multi-agent example test** — likely lands inline with that.

#### 14.5.4 Phase 7.6 foreseen building blocks (verification pass)
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 7.6*
- **VERIFY:** Reactive cursor (shared by `subscription` + `jobQueue`) — likely already shipped via `SubscriptionGraph` cursor + `JobQueueGraph` cursor. Confirm during Phase 12 / Phase 13 work; if shipped, archive the roadmap item.
- **VERIFY:** Factory composition helper — Phase 13.C `selector` + `materialize` likely subsumes this. Archive when 13.C lands.
- **WAIT:** Cross-island state bridge — Astro-specific demo concern; not core lib. Demote to demo-side concern (Phase 16 if relevant).
- **WAIT:** Guard-aware describe (`describe({ showDenied: true })`) — small describe option; defer until consumer.
- **WAIT:** Time simulation `monotonicNs()` test-mode override — non-trivial infrastructure; defer until concrete `vi.useFakeTimers()` integration request.

#### 14.5.5 §9.6 Framework infiltration package list
*Source: roadmap.md §9.6 "Framework infiltration packages"; lands in Phase 16 launch wave*
Captured here so Phase 16 doesn't underbid scope:
- `@graphrefly/ai-sdk` — Vercel AI SDK middleware (`graphreflyMiddleware` wrapping any model).
- `@graphrefly/langgraph` — LangGraph TS tools (Zod-validated tools exposing graph operations). Note: LangGraph consumes MCP natively, so §9.3 MCP server may suffice.
- 3 golden template repos: incident triage reduction; agent run observatory; alert dedup/prioritization.

#### 14.5.6 §9.7 Demo 6 stream extractor showcase + Demo 2 Multi-Agent Task Board
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 7.3 + 7.3b + §9.7*
- **Phase 16 deliverable:** Demo 0 (Personal email triage), Demo 6 (AI Agent Observatory), Demo 7 (Log Reduction).
- **Phase 16 deliverable, multi-agent-dependent:** Demo 2 (Multi-Agent Task Board, React + WebLLM + Gemma 4 E2B) — unblocked by Phase 13 multi-agent layer. Showcase the new `agent()` + `spawnable()` primitives.
- **Phase 16 deliverable, distinct demo:** Inbox-stream demo (`website/src/content/docs/demos/inbox-stream.md`) — per-email classify topology that genuinely shows reactive-savings + `graph.explain` UX. Pairs with the existing inbox-reducer baseline.
- **POST-1.0 (post-launch):** Demos 1, 3, 4, 5 — order pipeline, monitoring dashboard, docs assistant, observability pipeline. Park.

#### 14.5.7 Phase 8.x scale work
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 8.5, 8.6, 8.8 (Phase 8.7 Delta + WAL is in Phase 14)*
**ALL POST-1.0 — see Parked table.** No pre-1.0 placement:
- Phase 8.5 — `peerGraph(transport)`, `shardedGraph(shardFn)`, adaptive sampling, 10k-node benchmark suite.
- Phase 8.6 — `GraphCodec` pluggable serialization (`DagCborCodec`, `DagCborZstdCodec`, codec negotiation for `peerGraph`). Codec envelope v1 already shipped (Tier 4); pluggable codecs deferred.
- Phase 8.8 — Memory optimization (lazy meta materialization, bounded history with ring buffer / time eviction / spill-to-disk, structural sharing, node pooling, lazy hydration). Dormant subgraph eviction is already in Parked.

#### 14.5.8 Phase 6.x content addressing
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 6.1 / 6.2 / 6.3*
**ALL POST-1.0 — see Parked table.** Versioning depth not blocking 1.0:
- 6.1 — Lazy CID computation.
- 6.2 — V2 schema validation at node boundaries.
- 6.3 — V3 caps (serialized guard policy) + refs (cross-graph references).

#### 14.5.9 Phase 7.4 + 7.5 quality hardening
*Source: roadmap.md Phase 7.4 scenario tests + 7.5 inspection stress tests*
**POST-LAUNCH — see Parked table.** Demo-shaped scenario tests (order pipeline, agent task board, monitoring dashboard, docs assistant) and inspection stress tests (describe consistency under batch drain, observe correctness under concurrent updates, Graph.diff perf on 500-node graphs, snapshot during drain, etc.) ride along with their owning demos / shipping. EH-19 `validateNoIslands` perf is already tracked under Phase 11.4 Wait.

#### 14.5.10 Inspection consolidation PY parity
*Source: roadmap.md "Inspection Tool Consolidation > PY consolidation/new tools"*
**PARKED with PY parity umbrella.** PY `spy()` → `observe(format=)`, `trace_log()` → `trace()`, `Graph.diff()` port, `harness_trace()` Python implementation, runner `__repr__` diagnostics. All gated on the PY parity reopen post-1.0.

---

### Phase 15 — Eval program

*Source: roadmap.md §9.1 "Eval Program (umbrella)" + Wave 1 "The Eval Story"; deferred 2026-04 per re-prioritization*

**Pushed AFTER Phase 13** — eval program needs agent-layer + memory + harness primitives stable. Pushed AFTER Phase 14 — eval-side reactivity benefits from the new delta protocol.

**DESIGN-SESSION-NEEDED (DS-15):** opens Phase 15. Walks:
- Two-tier eval shape (fast synthetic + slow human-graded; reference: `archive/docs/SESSION-eval-blog-materials.md`, `SESSION-eval-story-reframe.md`).
- Catalog automation (§9.1b) — `autoSolidify(verifyResult, reflectOutput, catalog)` in REFLECT stage; ties Phase 13 agent + multi-agent verifiers to catalog growth.
- Harness scorecard (roadmap §9.4).
- Eval adapter stack migration (retire `evals/lib/llm-client.ts` + eval-specific rate-limiter / replay-cache / budget-gate in favor of library adapter layer; Wave A Unit 12 cross-cutting).

---

### Phase 16 — Launch wave (post-Phase-15)

*Source: roadmap.md Wave 2 "The Harness Layer" + Wave 3 "The Existential Demo"*

Lands when Phase 15 ships. Major items, each potentially its own session:

**Distribution / packages:**
- **§9.3 MCP Server** (`@graphrefly/mcp-server`) — distribution priority per `archive/docs/SESSION-harness-engineering-strategy.md`. Publish to npm; submit to MCP registry, Cline Marketplace, PulseMCP; "Try it with Claude Code in 2 minutes" quickstart.
- **§9.3b OpenClaw Context Engine Plugin** (`@graphrefly/openclaw-context-engine`) — ContextEngine 3-hook interface; reactive memory graph with `Graph.attachStorage`. Publish + plugin-registry submission.
- **§9.3c CLI surface** (`@graphrefly/cli`) — publish to npm with single `bin` entry; `npx @graphrefly/cli` zero-install; CI smoke test every subcommand.
- **§9.6 Framework infiltration** (per Phase 14.5.5):
  - `@graphrefly/ai-sdk` — Vercel AI SDK middleware.
  - `@graphrefly/langgraph` — LangGraph TS tools (Zod-validated).
  - 3 golden template repos: incident triage reduction; agent run observatory; alert dedup/prioritization.
- **Phase 7 launch admin (roadmap.md Phase 7):** README with "graph + re + fly" tagline; `@graphrefly/graphrefly` npm publish; docs site at `graphrefly.dev`; community launch (HN, Reddit, dev.to).

**Demos:**
- **§9.3e Spending Alerts demo** (mostly DONE 2026-04-21; interactive 3-pane Astro shell remaining).
- **§9.5 Demo 0** Personal email triage (NL → GraphSpec → flow → run → persist → explain). Video/GIF required to gate Show HN.
- **§9.7 Demo 6** AI Agent Observatory — harness engineering showcase + self-improving loop. `agentLoop` failure → `explainPath` causal chain → REFLECT distill into `agentMemory` → strategy model update → re-run avoids failure route.
- **Demo 2 Multi-Agent Task Board** (per Phase 14.5.6) — React + WebLLM + Gemma 4 E2B; showcases Phase 13 `agent()` + `spawnable()` primitives.
- **Inbox-stream demo** (per Phase 14.5.6) — per-email classify topology that genuinely shows reactive-savings + `graph.explain`. Pairs with the existing `inbox-reducer` baseline.
- Optional **stream extractor showcase** appendix to Demo 6 (mount multiple extractors on a single `streamingPromptNode`; visible-in-real-time inspection demo).

**Public-facing copy:**
- **§9.4 Harness scorecard public release** (`graphrefly.dev/scorecard`) — folded into §9.1.5 Phase 15 deliverables; Phase 16 is the publish step.
- **§9.2 deliverables for announcement:** "GraphReFly vs LangGraph" comparison page; blog "Why agent harnesses need reactive graphs".
- **Wave 1 deliverables:** blog "How evals proved catalog quality is the #1 lever, and we automated it"; "Reproduce our evals" guide; multi-model comparison results page; pre-launch outreach to 20-30 design partners.
- **Wave 2.5 deliverables:** blog "The feedback loop is the product — why we don't ship 6 optimization algorithms"; comparison page "GraphReFly refineLoop vs DSPy vs agent-opt".
- **Wave 3 deliverables:** Show HN ("GraphReFly — the reactive harness layer for agent workflows"); Reddit (r/AI_Agents, r/typescript, r/ClaudeCode); 小红书 original "为什么 Agent Harness 需要 reactive graph"; harness-engineering.ai knowledge graph submission.
