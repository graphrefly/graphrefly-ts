/**
 * Message envelope emitted by queue consumers when `autoAck: false`. The
 * caller is responsible for calling `ack()` after successful processing or
 * `nack()` to re-queue / dead-letter. Pairs cleanly with reactive pipelines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const messages$ = fromPulsar(consumer, { autoAck: false });
 * effect([messages$], ([m]) => {
 *   try {
 *     process(m.value);
 *     m.ack();
 *   } catch (err) {
 *     m.nack({ requeue: true });
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Ack/nack are imperative callbacks (§5.10 boundary) because the underlying
 * SDKs expose them as such. Reactive-all-the-way ack flows can be built by
 * piping `msg.ack` calls into a `reactiveSink` if desired.
 *
 * **Caller contract — must settle every emitted message.** The envelope holds
 * a closure reference to the raw SDK message; unsettled envelopes keep the
 * broker's in-flight window full and leak memory proportional to consumer
 * throughput. Patterns that drop messages (filter, take-first, switchMap
 * discard) must explicitly `nack({ requeue: true })` the discarded ones, or
 * wrap the source to force-settle on teardown.
 *
 * **Ack/nack transport failures.** Both methods route exceptions through
 * the source's `onAckError` option (when provided) — SDK rejections from
 * `acknowledge()`/`negativeAcknowledge()` don't escape as unhandled
 * rejections. Default (no `onAckError`): swallow. The broker handles
 * redelivery on its own timeline.
